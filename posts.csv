"When did you guys get engaged?!""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When will the wedding be?!""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A red Range Rover pulled up and Daxton opened the door, helping me inside. He slipped in after me, shutting the door and signaling for the driver to pull off. I groaned and kicked off my shoes, trying to bend over and massage my feet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You're failing miserably."""" Daxton said", amusement gleaming in his eyes. I huffed and stopped.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Well you try being pregnant and bending over at the same time."""" I grumbled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Here," let me."""" Daxton grabbed my feet and pulled them onto his lap. He started slowly massaging one of them and I moaned as the dull ache disappeared.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ugh," yes. That feels so good."""" I closed my eyes"," enjoying the feeling. """"Does your driver know where I live?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You're not going home."""" I frowned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Where are we going then?"""" I asked", rubbing my belly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To see my parents."""" My eyes shot open.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What?! Dax," no! They hate me!"""" I whined. His parents", especially his mother always thought I wasn't 'rich' enough or high enough on the social ladder for their son, even though my family came from old money. He switched to my other foot, ignoring my complaints.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have to announce our engagement to them and that you're....pregnant," before they see it on TV or a magazine. They'll be pissed if we don't."""" He hesitated before saying the word.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wait," I thought the engagement part was only for the press.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If we want to keep our good names," our parents have to think it's real too."""" He explained. I thought about what he said and a terrible thought crossed my mind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But if we have to keep this up," that means...""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes," we have to get married.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
***,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ignored him for the rest of the ride to his parents house. How dare he say we have to get married without my consent. I was furious with him that I didn't even look at him. I ignored everything he asked me, facing forward, even though that meant no more nice foot massages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When we pulled up to the driveway, Daxton turned to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Look, Ari," we have to look like a happy couple for my parents so that they don't question us too much. So can you please save your pouting for later?"""" I rolled my eyes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whatever."""" I went to open my door", but Daxton stopped me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Don't even think about it."""" He said", getting out and coming around to my side. He opened my door and lifted me out like I weighed nothing. He set me down gently and straightened out his black suit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You ready?"""" He asked", looking down at me. I scoffed, and fixed my hair in the window.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Are you crazy? I'll never be ready to mingle with your parents."""" He cracked a smile at my statement before going back to his stoic stance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Come on."""" He grabbed my hand and tingles went up my spine. I have got to get back control of my body because these reactions are not okay. It's the hormones", I thought, trying to convince myself that I wasn't still in love with my ex.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We walked to the front door of the large house and rang the doorbell. Nervousness shot through me and the worse thoughts crossed my mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr. and Mrs. King stood in the doorway and immediately smiled when they saw Daxton. Daxton looked exactly like his father, both with black hair and green eyes. His mother on the other hand, had dark, graying brown hair and grey eyes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daxton! What a surprise!"""" His mother exclaimed", grinning. He smiled back and I stood uncomfortably, waiting for them to acknowledge me. When they did, their smiles dropped.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh," Arielle. This is....definitely a surprise."""" Mr. King said warily", eyeing my pregnant belly. I kind of liked him, but he never stood up for himself, letting his wife run over him...and me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is indeed."""" I responded", containing eye contact. I will not be looked on as weak just because I'm pregnant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Are you guys going to invite us in? Ari can't stand on her feet too long."""" I thanked Daxton with my eyes", feet starting to hurt already. I hated that about pregnancy. I was like a little china doll, fragile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh," of course! You're lucky because I just finished making lunch."""" Mrs. King invited us in"," shutting the door behind us. """"I hope you like sushi."""" My stomach growled at the sound of my favorite food", luckily not loud enough for everyone to hear it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I looked around the foyer, taking in the place I used to frequent last year. My, how times have changed. Daxton led me to the table and pulled out my chair. When I sat down, his hands lingered on my shoulders before he took a seat to the right of me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
While Mrs. King went to get the food, Daxton and his father chatted easily and I smiled at how enthusiastic and relaxed he seemed, unlike when he was at work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So, Arielle," how's the company? Your father still working his life away?"""" Mr. King asked me and I chuckled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He sure is. He seemed to be working even harder, if that's even possible," ever since I told him I was pregnant."""" I smiled to myself", shaking my head at the thought. I told my parents when I found out I was pregnant. At first they weren't happy, but they got over it. Hopefully it will be just as easy to tell Daxton's parents.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ahh, that's the Antonio I know. Send him my regards," will you?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of course."""" I answered and he smiled at me. I smiled back and looked up when Daxton's mom came back in with a tray of drinks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Here you are."""" She set down the drinks in front of us and they all proceeded to drink. But I looked at my drink and immediately knew it was alcohol. Mrs. King looked at me over her glass"," eyes burning into my soul. """"Drink up"," Arielle.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I frowned at her. Was she serious? """"I'm pregnant. I can't drink."""" I ground out", trying to keep my cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mom," are you serious?"""" Daxton asked", bewildered. She put a hand on her chest, taking my drink.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh my," I'm so very sorry. I'll get you some orange juice."""" She knew damn well she didn't forget I was pregnant. That witch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Water will be great," thanks."""" I told her. There's no telling what she would put in my orange juice. At least with water", I can tell if it's been spiked. I looked at Daxton and he shook his head. She came back with my water and the sushi, sitting down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Arielle," what brings you here.....with Daxton?"""" Mrs. King asked", feigning innocence. Since she wanted to be like that, I decided to burst her bubble.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We're here to tell you guys about my pregnancy."""" I stated. She coughed in her napkin", dabbing her mouth afterwards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why would you do that," dear? Certainly it has nothing to do with us...or Daxton."""" I smiled at her", knowing she was hoping that what she was thinking was not true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh, it has everything to do with you," Mrs. King."""" I smirked"," lifting my eyebrows. """"You see", your son Daxton," is the father."""" She gasped", putting her hand to her chest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Preposterous! Daxton would never knock up some..some low-life."""" My mouth hung open at her insult.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mother!"""" Daxton yelled and she turned to him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tell me it's not true," son. Please."""" She begged", eyes wide. Daxton's jaw ticked as he tried not to go off on his mom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's a boy."""" Was all he said. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Did I forget to mention that we're engaged?"""" I butt in", showing her my ring. I grinned smugly as she tuned red with anger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ari," don't."""" Daxton said lowly. I frowned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Don't what? Tell her the truth? She was going to find out sooner or later."""" I argued.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How dare you trick my son into marrying you," you slut!"""" Mrs. King screamed at me and launched herself across the table", wrapping her hands around my throat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Denise!"""" Mr. King grabbed his wife and pulled her away from me", her nails scratching my throat in the process. Pain ignited on my neck, and my hand shook as I touched it. Specks of blood spotted my fingers and I got up from the table, stepping away from his deranged family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm disappointed in you," Daxton. Disappointed!"""" His mother yelled as Mr. King took her away. Daxton sighed and ran his fingers through his hair.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ari," you should've let me handle it."""" He said and I balked. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Let you handle it? She would've taken it just as hard if you had told her."""" Daxton shook his head and stood up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No, she would've understood if I explained it to her. You just provoked her purposely," that's why she reacted the way she did."""" I couldn't believe what my ears were hearing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Are you telling me this is my fault? You think I wanted your crazy ass mother attacking me like some animal?!"""" I yelled. Daxton just stared at me", confirming what I just said. I scoffed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You are something else," you know that. And to think I thought you actually changed."""" I laughed bitterly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All I'm saying is that you had it coming for you," blurting it out like that.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What!?"""" I shrieked"," anger coursing through my body. """"You know what"," I should press charges. Assault on a pregnant woman. How does that sound Dax?"""" His eyes darkened and he stalked towards me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You wouldn't."""" He said darkly. I stepped up to him", eyes trained on him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Try me."""" Footsteps sounded behind Dax and I looked behind his shoulder to see Mr. King coming back. He seemed stressed as he ran his fingers through his hair repeatedly", like Daxton does when he's stressed out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm so sorry, Arielle. If I knew she would've reacted like that," I would've-""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No," Mr. King. There was no way you could've known."""" I didn't want him feeling bad when it wasn't his fault.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay. Well," congratulations on your engagement and pregnancy. I'm sure you both will be great parents.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thank you."""" I smiled at him before looking at Dax. We'll see about that. """"I'm ready to leave."""" With that", I turned around and walked out the door, not waiting to see if Daxton was behind me or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I slipped into the vehicle and didn't look at Daxton when he slid in next to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My penthouse," Alfred."""" He told the driver.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um, no. My house please," Alfred."""" I gave him the address and saw Daxton frowning from my peripheral vision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ari-"""" I held up my hand to shush him", not wanting to hear a word of what he had to say. He didn't even stand up for me when his crazy mother attacked me, saying I deserved it. What the fuck? Who says that? I rolled my eyes and leaned my head back, tired from today's events.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When we reached my house, Daxton sped to my side opening my door, and tried to help me out. I swatted his hand away and helped myself out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We need to talk later."""" He said. I ignored him and unlocked the door", stepping inside. Like hell we did. Since Rayna's car wasn't outside, I assumed she was with Sam. I sighed and threw my keys on the counter. Just then, a bumping sound came from one of my guest rooms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Frowning, I grabbed a broom and proceeded to find the source of that sound. Heavy breathing came from the room I stood in front of and I braced myself for whatever was inside before slamming the door open.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A scream slipped through my lips and I shut my eyes immediately. Rayna and Marco scrambled to cover themselves," but the image of Marco plowing into her was forever branded into my brain.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64697;""""""Ari! You weren't supposed to be here yet."""" Rayna picked up Marco's shirt and threw it over her", following after me as I walked away," hands over my eyes. """"Ari."""" She grabbed my arm and pulled me to a stop. I dropped my hand and stared into her wide eyes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What the fuck," Ray! Are you and Sam on a break or something?"""" I asked. She bit her lip and shook her head. """"Rayna!"""" I yelled", turning around and walking into the living room, needing to sit down before I did something I regretted. Marco came out the room, shirtless, but at least he had pants on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm sorry," Ari. It just sorta...happened."""" I chuckled bitterly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It just happened? Is that what you're gonna say to Sam when you tell him that you cheated on him with Marc?"""" She flinched at my words and I turned my head to Marco. """"What about you? What do you have to say for yourself?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He shifted uncomfortably as he explained that him and Rayna have had feelings for each other for years, but never acted on it because they didn't want anything to be weird between them if they ever got together and then broke up. I sighed and put massaged my forehead, a headache coming on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You need to tell Sam."""" I pointed to Ray. """"And you.."""" I swung my finger to Marco. """"...I don't really know what you should do. Just....wait till Ray breaks up with Sam before banging my friend...again."""" He cracked a smile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Anything for my favorite pregnant lady."""" He kissed my cheek and I swatted him away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ew," get away."""" I didn't want any sex germs from him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alright," I have to leave and get to work. I'll see you guys later."""" Marco left", leaving me with a nervous best friend. I sighed and reached forward, pulling her onto the couch to sit next to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Are you mad at me?"""" Rayna asked quietly", playing with her brown hair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Of course not. It's your life to live," not mine. I'm more disappointed at you. Why did you do it?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She pouted her lips. """"I just.....don't feel anything for Sam anymore. He's been into a lot of illegal stuff", mafia wise and I don't want to be caught up in all of that," ya know?"""" I nodded", totally understanding. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My ex, Lance was into the same thing, which is why we broke up. And the fact that he was an asshole and treated me like shit. Sam and Lance were best friends, so that's hows Ray and him met.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You need to break it off with him," then. Today. Don't wait or things will just get worse."""" I explained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I will. Thanks for understanding," Ari."""" She hugged me tight and I laughed", hugging her back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's what best friends are for. Now go buy me some sushi. Daxton's mom went all bat-shit crazy on me earlier," so I didn't get to eat.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Aye aye captain."""" She saluted and grabbed her keys before taking off to the sushi place. When she came back", we sat on the couch eating the sushi and I told her everything that happened when Daxton took me to have lunch with his parents.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She tried to make you drink wine? That bitch! I should've been there."""" She said with her mouth full of food. I chuckled and shook my head. After eating", I sat back and patted my pockets for my phone. I realized I hadn't checked it for days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ray," where's my phone?"""" I asked", looking under the cushions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh," right here. You left it like last week when you went into depression mode. Here."""" She tossed it to me and I caught it perfectly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I had a few texts from my job, just saying that they transferred money to my account. I deleted those and read the messages from my parents. They just wanted to see me as soon as I had a break. I was about to turn my phone off when I saw that I had a message from Daxton. It was from two hours ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We need to talk. Meet me at the office in 10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oops. Well, it's never too late. I got up, still in my dress from earlier, grabbed my purse and keys and left, not before yelling to Ray that I was going out. I drove to Daxton's workplace and parked in the CEO #2 spot. He won't mind, I thought, walking into the building. Plus, I should work things out with him if he was going to be in my life from now on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jessica, the receptionist, spotted me and smiled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Here to see Mr. King?"""" I nodded and she walked me to the elevator like she did the first time I met her. I frowned to myself. I was not totally helpless just because I was pregnant. Like before", the elevator stopped constantly and I grew uncomfortable as the spaces got smaller.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I sighed with relief when floor thirty appeared. Walking off, I proceeded to Daxton's office, memorizing where it was located. I laughed at the fact that I had forgotten where it was last time, even though months ago, I had frequented this place. When I got there, the door was cracked open, so I pushed it wider and saw that the office was empty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Frowning, I looked around the large office and was about to leave, when I heard noises coming from the secret room he had inside his office. Why would he be in there, I thought as I walked and opened the door. The second I saw the scene in front of me, I wished I would've left when I didn't see him the first time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the secret office was a large bed. On the edge of very large bed was a very skinny girl, moaning loudly as Daxton, who was standing on the side of the bed, thrust hard into her repeatedly. I froze, not able to take my eyes off them. Tears welled up in my eyes and my chest tightened. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh, yes Daxton," harder!"""" The girl yelled. My purse dropped from my hands and Daxton looked up", his eyes widening when he saw me standing in the doorway. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That made me unfreeze and I turned away, trying to get out of there as fast as possible. Tears streamed down my face and I hurried to the elevator, pushing past people as I went. How dumb could I be, thinking he wouldn't have sex with anyone else since I was pregnant with his child. Deep down, I actually thought he cared for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ari!"""" Daxton voice carried down the hallway and I panicked", pressing the button harder so that the elevator could come faster. Daxton appeared and he looked left and right before spotting me. The elevator door opened and I hurried on, pressing the close button.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He growled as people got in his way as he tried to make it to the elevator before the doors closed. I breathed a sigh of relief as the elevator went down. Not many people got on as it went down, which I was grateful for. When I got to the lobby, I reached for my keys, but came up empty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fuck!"""" I yelled", hitting the wall. I left my purse in Daxton's office.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arielle!"""" I turned and gasped when I saw Daxton running at full speed towards me. He actually came after me? I didn't stop to think about that because I sped walked out the doors and kept walking", not caring where I ended up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A hand grabbed my shoulder and I turned, swinging at the person.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shit," Ari. Stop it."""" Daxton grabbed my wrist and I swung the other one. He grabbed that one too and stepped close to me", breathing hard from all the running he did. His hair was disheveled and his eyes were dark with irritation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let go of me," Dax."""" I said", trying to get out of his iron grip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No."""" His eyes challenged me to protest and I sighed with defeat. """"Why did you leave?"""" A pang shot through my chest at that question.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why did I leave? Did you really want me to stay there while you banged some whore?!"""" I yelled", tears coming back. I couldn't control my emotions as anger washed through me, along with hurt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Look," I-""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No! Don't try and explain yourself! I'm tired of these games you like to play. Make me feel like you actually feel something for me one day," and then next treat me like shit!"""" He let my hands go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ari-"""" He tried again", but I was full on ranting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe it's these hormones but I'm tired of walking in on people fucking each other! Especially you," dammit! I'm just so-"""" I broke down", sobs coming out in full force.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fuck, Ari, come on," don't cry."""" Daxton pulled me into his chest and I cried my heart out. I hated that he made me feel so vulnerable and weak.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You're such an asshole."""" I sobbed and I felt him sigh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm sorry."""" I paused", sniffing back the snot that threatened to slide out my nose. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What?"""" I whispered", lifting my head to look up at him. He blew his hair our his face and looked down at me, eyes sincere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm sorry, Ari. Fuck," you don't understand. I don't-"""" He breathed out his nose"," seeming to try to find the right things to say. """"I don't like hurting you. I just...nevermind. Forget I said anything."""" He turned to walk away", but I grabbed his hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No," Dax. Tell me. You just what?"""" Instead of answering", he turned back to me, stalked forward," and crashed his lips onto mine.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64698;""I was shocked at the fact that he was kissing me. I was about to start enjoying it when I realized he had just come from having sex with that whore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ew, oh my god," sex germs!"""" I pushed him away and spit repeatedly", trying to get the taste of him out of my mouth. He smirked smugly, knowing that I enjoyed the kiss as much as he did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didn't eat her out," just so you know."""" I blanched and covered my ears.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jesus Christ, Dax," I didn't need to know that."""" He shrugged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didn't kiss her either," if it makes you feel any better."""" It actually did make me feel better", not that I was going to admit that. Now I regretted stopping that wonderful kiss.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay," it doesn't matter. How about we make a truce. No sex for you with anybody until the baby is at least two years old."""" His eyes bugged out of his face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Two years?! No fucking way.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I wanna make sure our baby doesn't have any siblings popping out anytime soon."""" He groaned and ran his hand down his face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay, fine," but that goes for you too."""" I rolled my eyes and gestured to my very pregnant and bloated body.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Does it look like I'm having sex anytime soon?"""" He didn't answer me", only raising his eyebrows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ugh," fine."""" He stuck out his hand and I shook it. """"So"," what did you need to talk about?"""" I asked", wiping the sweat off my hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh, uh," we can find another time to talk about it. I just wanted to talk about what we're gonna be naming him."""" He shifted nervously. I smiled", reveling at the fact that something finally made him nervous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay," that's cool. How about tomorrow afternoon?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That's perfect. I'll see you then."""" He was about to walk away", but he turned back and handed me something. It was my purse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How kind of you."""" I mocked", chuckling. He smiled and shook his head, walking away from me. I was very hungry, so I decided to go to the nearest cafe to get a bite to eat. I drove for about five minutes before spotting one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hallelujah."""" I mumbled", getting out of the car, stomach growling loudly. I felt my baby kick and I smiled, knowing he was hungry too. When I entered, I groaned at how long the line was. Nevertheless, I stood in line, rubbing my belly with one hand and resting my hand on my hip with the other. I started humming my favorite tune to pass the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Excuse me miss?"""" I stopped humming and looked up", seeing the cashier trying to get my attention.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This gentleman here wants you to come up to the front."""" I lifted my eyebrows", surprised at the gesture. I walked to the front and spotted who my savior was. My eyes widened and my heart immediately started to pound when I saw who it was.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jeremy Ringer, most popular guy in high school,my secret crush, and former best friend. He was always very good looking with his brown hair and striking hazel green eyes. The cream suit he had on accented his muscular body and I just about fainted. He smiled down at me and a dimple appeared on his cheek. Dear mother of god.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jeremy?"""" I whispered not believing it was him. He had moved about five years ago with his dad because he was always in so much trouble.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hey," princess. How have you been?"""" My words slipped my mind as I stared at him with awe. """"Ari?"""" He waved a hand in front of my face and I snapped out of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jeremy."""" I breathed again. """"W-what are you doing here? I thought you moved."""" I said", ordering some pastries and coffee. The guy brought me and Jeremy's order and we took it to a booth in the corner of the cafe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's what everyone thought," but I just skipped town for a few weeks before coming back."""" His easy smile brought one to my face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But enough about me. What about you," princess? I hear you're expecting a son and that you're engaged. Congratulations."""" I laughed lightly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks, Jer," but I have to be honest. We're not even engaged really. We just wanted the media off our backs."""" He nodded", understanding my predicament.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So, Daxton," huh?"""" I blushed"," which made his grin even wider. He leaned forward and took my hands. A warm feeling spread through my body at his touch. """"Why not me?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My mouth opened and closed. """"I-I thought you moved away and I didn't think you shared my feelings"," so I didn't want to waste either or our time."""" His fingers rubbed my knuckles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Princess," you knew how I felt about you."""" He said quietly", hazel eyes boring into my soul. This was true. I knew how Jeremy felt about me, but I didn't want to take any chances.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was scared. You were a wild boy, Jeremy. I always thought that deep down," you would hurt me in the end. And everyone else telling me the same didn't help."""" His eyes darkened dramatically when ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I mentioned other people, but then it disappeared and his charming smile came back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He scooted forward," making me lean more towards him. """"How about....we start over?"""" Start over?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jer," I''m pregnant with someone else's child. By the man you hate."""" I added. He lifted his hand and trailed it down my cheek. A burning path was left in its wake and I tried my hardest not to just kiss him right then and there. Hormones", get it together.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So? I like you," princess and I want you to give me a chance. Can you do that for me? Please?"""" He asked softly", sweet breath blowing onto my face. I felt myself nodding and a grin lit up his face. Does he ever stop smiling? He leaned forward and placed his lips on mine, kissing me just for a second. Whoa.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What was that for?"""" I breathed softly. He grinned slyly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How does tomorrow sound? At noon?"""" He ignored my question and I shook my head", remembering how he always used to do that when we were younger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sounds great."""" He kissed my cheek this time before sliding out the booth and disappearing out the door. I slumped back", trying to catch my breath. He was going to be the death of me. I thought about what I was going to wear tomorrow on our date at noon----shit!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Daxton wanted to meet me at noon tomorrow.....and so did Jeremy. I groaned and hoped that one of them came earlier than the other. If not," blood would probably be spilled.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64699;""She craves for riches. Silver and gold. A million dollars at her disposal. A great big mansion", with dozens of rooms. Hundreds of objects that she'll never use. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He wants power. A feeling of superiority. Absolute authority. Subordinates at his beck and call. Everything is under his control. He is the king. Master of all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh," what a beautiful couple.  """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64700;""I woke up the next day", feeling relaxed. I looked at my phone and gasped when I saw that it was 11:15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ray!"""" I yelled", scrambling out of bed. When she didn't answer I yelled her name again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What," you psycho?"""" She walked into my room", rubbing her eyes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You didn't wake me up! I was supposed to tell Daxton that I couldn't meet with him today."""" I hurried to my bathroom and stripped off my clothes", Rayna following closely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ohhh yeah," so you can go on that date with Jer-Bear."""" She wiggled her eyebrows and I rolled my eyes and started my bath. When the tub was filled", I slipped in and sighed as the heat caressed my muscles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shut up."""" I mumbled. She laughed and turned to leave.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Better hurry," slowpoke."""" She sang waltzing out my room. I groaned", wondering how I was going to deal with this situation. I decided I would just call Jeremy (I got his number before we left the cafe) and cancel. Or maybe I'll call Daxton.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ugh," this is why I'm single."""" I said out loud", getting out of the tub. I dried and lotioned myself and decided to wear a simple spaghetti strapped, black dress that stop just above my knee. Slipping on my furry house slippers, I walked out the room and into the kitchen. I stopped in my tracks when I saw Dax sitting at the bar, talking and laughing with Rayna.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My eyes raked down his body, loving the way his dress shirt hugged his muscles. He had rolled up the sleeves until it reached his elbow, so I could see the veins that bulged from his forearms. I continued up, wanting to run my fingers through his neat hair. When I finally looked at his eyes, I almost jumped when I saw his arrogant smirk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"See something you like?"""" He asked", winking. I scoffed and continued going into the kitchen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not even close."""" He frowned", knowing I was lying my ass off. After I ate my favorite cereal, I sat at the table and Daxton followed suit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Before we start talking," I have to tell you that I accidentally-"""" The sound of the doorbell ringing interrupted me. I hurried to the door and looked out the peephole. """"Shit!"""" It was Jeremy and he was holding flowers in his hand. How the hell did he know where I lived? I ignored that fact", deciding to deal with that later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I opened the door and forced a smile on my face.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jeremy! Hey! I wasn't...expecting you here."""" I emphasized here. He smiled at me and my heart sped up a bit. Jesus", he was beautiful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I decided to surprise you. I didn't want you driving, especially since you're pregnant. Here," these are for you."""" He handed me the flowers and a real smile lit up my face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Aww thank you so much! You didn't have to."""" He looked down at me", adoration evident in his eyes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of course I did. You deserve-""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What the fuck," Ari!"""" Daxton stormed towards the door", anger clouding his face. Uh oh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uh," am I interrupting something here?"""" Jeremy looked between me and Daxton", confused.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No," not at all! I just accidentally told you guys to come at the same time and I-""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So you plan something knowing we needed to talk? I bet you brought him over to fuck."""" Daxton spit out. I gasped at his accusation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dax," I'm not-""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Save it. Deal's over. I'll fuck who I wanna fuck since you think you can do the same thing."""" He brushed past me", shoved Jeremy, and walked out my house. I felt hurt, but I refused to cry over him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arielle? You okay?"""" Jeremy asked", stepping into my house. I was in a daze, still trying to comprehend what Daxton just said. He blew up out of nowhere. I knew he didn't like Jeremy and vice versa but really?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you wanna leave too," go ahead."""" I said", voice cracking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ari.."""" He engulfed me into a hug and I accepted his embrace. I needed someone to just hold me right now. """"I won't ever leave you"," okay."""" A small tear slipped out of my eye and I nodded. I didn't say anything", knowing that someday, he would leave me. It always happened.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
***,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No way!"""" I yelled", laughing loudly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes way! I almost fell off the cliff doing that too."""" Jeremy explained", laughing along with me. He was telling tales of when he was in Australia, cliff-diving with his friends. I decided earlier to go to his house, wanting to forget everything dealing with Daxton.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So what other place did you visit?"""" I asked", folding my feet underneath me. I was getting a little cold, but nothing unbearable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well," let's see. I went to Pa-"""" My phone started to ring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sorry. Hold on."""" I picked up my phone and answered without looking at the caller ID. """"Hello?"""" Heavy breathing fill my ear and I frowned. """"Who is this?"""" The person hung up and I looked at my phone. That was weird. I shrugged and tossed my phone beside me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Do you know who that was?"""" Jeremy asked", scooting close to me. I looked up at him, seeing that he was really interested in this. Weird.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No," the person was just breathing and then hung up. I don't recognize the number."""" I told him", leaning against him. He didn't reply," but started to stare at me with his piercing eyes. My pulse started to race unwillingly. """"What?"""" I whispered", not breathing right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He kept quiet and started to lean forward. I blushed when I realized what he was about to do, and I didn't want to stop him. Just then, my phone rang again, like water being dumped over us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jeremy cleared his throat. """"I", um," you should get that."""" His cheeks tinted pink and I nodded", grabbing my phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arielle! You need to get here now!"""" Rayna's panicked voice filled my ear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What happened?"""" I asked"," alarmed. """"Are you okay? Are you hurt?"""" I got off Jeremy's sofa", grabbing my purse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's Dax!"""" My heart jumped.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What happened?"""" I shouted"," repeating myself. I motioned to Jeremy to get up. """"Car."""" I whisper-yelled. He went to the counter and got his keys", confusion filling his face.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He got into an accident and he's in the hospital!"""" I gasped", my heart almost stopping.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What?!"""" I shrieked"," dragging Jeremy out the door. """"Drive to the hospital!"""" I buckled up"," hands shaking. """"How bad are the injuries?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pretty bad," I think. I don't know. I'm freaking out right now. Marco is here with me at the hospital. Dax is in a coma. A drunk driver his him and-"""" I stopped listening", feeling a panic attack coming on. No. Not Dax. Not the man I currently cannot stand, the father of my child.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ari? Ari! You there?"""" Rayna yelled through the phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What if there's nothing the doctor's can do? What if he stays in the coma forever? What if he dies?!"""" I asked freaking out. I pulled at my hair", anxiousness overwhelming me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ari, don't think like that, okay? Calm down," it's not good for the baby.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But Ray-""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do it for your baby boy," Ari. Please."""" She pleaded. I tried to steady my breathing", but I was too worried about Daxton. I hung up, feeling tears pool in my eyes. Jeremy took his eyes off the road for a second to look at me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Who's in the hospital?"""" He asked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daxton."""" I whispered", voice shaking. He nodded, understanding how I was feeling. He parked in a spot close to the hospital doors and helped me out the car.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daxton King's room."""" I said to the receptionist. She eyed me warily.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And you are?"""" She glanced down at my belly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"His fiancé. Now what's his room number?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sorry," family only."""" Excuse me? Anger shot through me and I slammed my hands on the counter. She jumped", leaning away from me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm the mother of his unborn child, dammit! You give me his room number now, or god so help me," I will-""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"241."""" I stopped my ranting when a doctor came behind her. He frowned at her. """"Next time a pregnant woman comes around asking for her fiancé's room number", you give it to her," got it?"""" The lady nodded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah," bitch."""" I said", walking towards the direction the doctor pointed out. I was nervous when I got to the room door, not sure I wanted to go in anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ari," it's okay."""" Jeremy whispered"," leading me into the room. Daxton's face was swollen and he had bruises all along his arms. Gauzes with large red stains covered his torso and that's when I fainted.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64701;""BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I groaned and opened my eyes. I recognized that sound. I looked around, and my surroundings confirmed my thoughts. I was in a hospital bed and that heart monitor was getting on my nerves. Suddenly, everything that happened crashed down and I gasped, remembering that Daxton was in the hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oh no you don't."""" I looked up to see Rayna taking my hand away from the IV that was stuck in my arm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But I have to go see Daxton."""" I whined", reaching to pull out the needle again. She gave me a stern look.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You fainted last time you saw Daxton. The nurse wants you to take it easy," especially since you're pregnant."""" I frowned. Just because I'm pregnant does not mean I'm made of freaking porcelain!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I need to see him."""" I put on my sad face and hoped it worked. Rayna's face dropped and she huffed before looking around.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay," but you have to be quick. These people watch patients like hawks."""" She pulled out my IV and helped me out of the bed. """"Good thing you don't have those dingy hospital clothes on."""" I chuckled and stretched", feeling a bit sore. Probably from laying on the uncomfortable bed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ray stuck her head out the door first, made sure the coast was clear, and then led me to Daxton's room. No one was in there, thank god, and my chest tightened when I saw Dax for the second time. He still looked just as bad as he did earlier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'll leave you two alone."""" Ray whispered. I nodded", not really caring. I glided to the chair beside his bed and sat down on it. He looked lost unrecognizable, but peaceful as he slept. I wondered how long he would be in the coma. What if he missed me having our baby?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The thought made tears leak out my eyes and I quickly wiped them away. I couldn't cry over him, I just couldn't. He's caused me nothing but grief. But then, he did have his nice days when he would care for me, make me feel loved....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rapid beeping shocked me out of my thoughts my heart quickened. Nurses and doctor poured in, bustling around frantically.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"His heart rate is dropping!"""" One yelled. I got up from the chair", panicking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What's happening?"""" I asked", afraid of the answer. No one answered me. They took out some paddles and rubbed it together," spitting out some medial lingo that I could not understand. """"Will someone please tell me what's going on?!"""" I yelled", pushing past the sea of medical assistants.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Get her out of here!"""" A doctor ordered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No! I wanna know what's going on!"""" I yanked my arm out of one of the nurses hold and she hesitated. She knew that roughing me up would not be the smartest thing to do since I could press charges and I'm pregnant. I tried to peek around the white coats to see Daxton", but they blocked my view.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The main doctor walked my way," a grim line set on his face. """"Ma'am"," you need to leave so we can do our job. You being here will not help the situation.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What's happening to him?"""" I whispered. He looked at the nurse before looking back at me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"His heart stopped. We're trying out best to revive him."""" I gasped", hand flying to my mouth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No."""" I breathed out"," tears spilling down my cheeks. """"No...No! No!"""" I started yelling and swinging "," not believing my ears. """"Save him! Don't let him die!"""" Someone came from behind and pulled me out the room while I thrashed around.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arielle! Calm down!"""" Jeremy's voice filled my ear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He's going to die! He can't die! I can't be a single mother! I'll kill him if he dies! He can't-"""" Sobs overtook my body and I grabbed the front of Jeremy's shirt", letting it all out. His hand came around me and he rubbed my back. This went on for a while before I finally ran out of tears.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I sat down in a chair outside the room and put both hands on my belly. I down at the floor, ignoring everybody. I sniffed and shudders from my episode still ran through my body and it looked like I was shivering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ari?"""" I heard Ray's voice", but I ignored her. After many attempts from the both of them, they finally stopped when they realized I wasn't going to speak to them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I stayed in that position all night and into the morning, still not speaking to anybody. I accepted the food and water that was given to me, but other than that, I was silent. Daxton was going to die and I would be all alone, with his child.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mrs. King?"""" The doctor called out. Who's Mrs. King? I raised my eyes to see that he was looking straight at me", clipboard in his hands. I didn't even bother correcting him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes?"""" My voice was hoarse from the nonstop crying and I could feel that my eyes were still puffy and red. He smiled hesitantly at me", but I kept a straight face. He cleared his throat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We have some good news."""" I perked up. Good news? """"Daxton woke up early this morning and-"""" I didn't wait for him to finish. I walked as fast as I could to Daxton's room and flung the door open. There he was", sitting up, green eyes looking around. They landed on me and felt my eyes start to water.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dax."""" I whispered"," not believing my eyes. He cracked a smile and motioned for me to come over. I did and hugged him tight. """"I thought you were dead! Your heart stopped and I freaked out and I-""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ari...can't breathe...ow.."""" His voice was strained and I quickly let him go", blushing furiously.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sorry."""" He smiled and I sat down", noticing that a lot of the swelling went down on his face. He still had scars on his forehead and purple bags underneath his eyes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You're actually here."""" He said", scanning my face. My brows furrowed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why wouldn't I be?"""" I asked. He looked away before answering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm such an asshole to you, Arielle," especially when you've been nothing but nice to me."""" He turned his bright eyes to me. """"I'm sorry. I truly am. I know apologies won't make up for how badly I've treated you"," but I'd like us to start over. For real this time."""" MY heart lodged in my throat at his words.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Could I give him another chance? Should I? What if he breaks my heart again? I ignored the voice inside of me and decided to give him another chance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Okay."""" I whispered. I grabbed his hand and he squeezed it and brought it to his lips. Tingles went down my body and I blushed lightly and looked away. I looked towards the door and saw Jeremy frowning. He looked and me and shook his head", leaving the room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What's he doing here?"""" Daxton didn't sound too happy with the fact that a guy he couldn't stand was in his hospital room.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He, uh," drove me here."""" I looked at Daxton", but he said nothing. The door squeaked and the doctor from the hallway came in, followed by Rayna, Marco, and Jeremy. Rayna looked at our hands and winked at me. I shook my head, cracking a smile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You seemed to have made a remarkable recovery," young man."""" The doctor said. Daxton smiled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank you sir. I'm sure it was all because of your wonderful staff. So," when can I go back to work?"""" He asked. The doctor laughed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You won't be going to work anytime soon. You have three broken ribs and they all need proper healing. Do you have anybody that can take care of you around the clock? If not," I can send one of my nurses home with you.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'll take care of him."""" My mouth moved before my brain could process what I just said. Everyone looked at me", eyes wide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ari," you don't have to-"""" I held my hand up", silencing Dax.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't have a problem doing it. Plus," there's nothing to do during the day anyway."""" He nodded and the doctor smiled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great! We have to run few more tests," but you should be able to leave by the end of the day today."""" He left the room and Marco came over", smacking Dax on the back. Dax winced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm glad she volunteered because I do not want to be the one to help out get dressed."""" Dax scowled as Marco laughed. """"I'll be dealing with your paperwork and stuff at work"," don't worry.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good. I'll make sure I give you a raise when I get back."""" Marco pumped his fists in the air. """"Ari"," you'll have to move in with me."""" He said it so casually", that I almost missed it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wait," what?"""" I turned to him", frowning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Everyone thinks we're engaged anyway and you can't keep driving back and forth so you might as well come stay with me.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I agree."""" Rayna said and Marco nodded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What the hell did I just get myself into?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64702;""""""Ari"," you have too much shit!"""" Rayna yelled", dragging the last of my stuff into Daxton's house. I chuckled and sat at the bar, eating a parfait, even though it was late at night.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shut up and just be happy that you own my house now."""" I muttered. """"You're welcome."""" Rayna huffed and skipped over to where I was sitting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thank you so much best friend in the whole wide world. I promise not to christen most of the rooms in the house with Marco."""" I almost puked in my mouth at her words. She laughed loudly at my facial expression.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Did you break up with him?"""" I asked", swirling my spoon in the yogurt. She got serious and nodded quietly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He--uh," didn't take it well."""" Ray sat down next to me and leaned her head against her hand"," sighing. """"But oh well. At least I have Marco."""" Before I could answer", a loud bang outside caught our attention.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fuck!"""" I smiled when I heard Daxton's voice and slid off the stool. Ray followed me outside", where we saw Daxton having a hard time getting up the ramp his butler installed a few days ago. My hand slid over my protruding belly and I laughed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He looked up, frowning that I found the situation amusing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ha ha. Real funny. You won't be laughing when I run you over with this wheelchair."""" He threatened and that made me laugh even harder. I felt the baby kick when he heard his dad's words and it warmed my heart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got you," bro."""" Marco joked behind Daxton's chair and wheeled him into the house", bumping his chair into the wall as he went.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dammit," Marc!"""" Dax cursed and Marco laughed like a hyena before wheeling him into the living room.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You know you can walk," right? Stop acting like a handicapped person."""" I commented", walking past him and plopping myself onto his comfy chair. He slowly turned to look at me and my heart skipped a beat. He licked his lips and a sly smile creeped onto his face.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then why don't you," uh-"""" He looked down at his pants before looking up at me"," raising an eyebrow. """"-help me out?"""" He asked winking. My heart rate accelerated and I could feel my face heating up at his suggestive words. Get it together", Ari! I chastised myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I got up slowly, mainly because I didn't want to fall and look stupid or injure the baby, and walked over to where his wheelchair was.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hmmm," or maybe.."""" I trailed my fingers up his chest and over is shoulder", gripping tightly. He shivered slightly and I smiled, liking the affect I still had on him. I leaned down," lips brushing his neck. A strangled groan slipped through his lips and his eyes fluttered closed. """"...you can just go fuck yourself."""" I whispered in his ear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Marco's laugh rang through the house at my words and Daxton's red face was priceless. """"I think it's time for us to leave."""" He chuckled", grabbing Ray's hand and walking out the house. When the door slammed closed, I turned on my heel and went upstairs to take a shower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ari!"""" Daxton shouted behind me and I ignored him", smiling smugly. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I got to the room, which was ironically Daxton's room, I stripped off my dress and undergarments and proceeded to set the temperature for my bath. When there was enough bubbles and water, I got in and groaned as the hot water caressed my sore muscles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I leaned back and closed my eyes, sighing with content. I was just starting to relax when the door was flung open. My eyes flew open and Daxton stalked in, obviously frustrated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daxton! Get out!"""" I yelled. He raised his eyebrows at my demand and kneeled down next to the tub.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's my room," princess. And my bathroom."""" He emphasized. His finger trailed on the edge of the tub before dipping into the water and my eyes followed the action. My breath caught when his hand rested on my belly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I looked in his eyes and his green ones smoldered with desire. """"What are you doing?"""" I whispered when his hand began to rub circles on my belly. Liquid heat shot straight to my core when his hand went lower", just above where I wanted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He chuckled softly and leaned forward, capturing my lips with his. I responded immediately, lifting my arms to wrap around his neck, bringing him closer. My body heated up and I groaned against his lips, missing the feeling he ignited through me months ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of his hands held the back of my head and the other slipped two fingers between my folds. I gasped and clamped around his fingers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Already wet for me," love?"""" He muttered against my neck and I couldn't form any words as his fingers picked up speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh," god-"""" I choked out"," wanting him to go faster. His pressed his lips on my neck and sucked the skin there. """"Dax--"""" I breathed", clutching his arm. Suddenly, his touch and lips were gone. I panted and ached for his fingers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Next time you tease me, princess," make sure you're ready to be teased back. Have fun finishing yourself off."""" Daxton said smugly", grinning at my dilemma. My face flamed and he walked out, fingers in his mouth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fuck!"""" I whisper-yelled", still hot and bothered. I refused to 'finish myself off', so I scrubbed myself clean, a jolt going through me when I passed over my swollen clit, a got out of the tub. I dried myself and threw on a robe over my naked body.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Feel better?"""" Daxton asked from his spot on the bed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fuck off."""" I muttered", passing the bed and heading to the door. If he was gonna be an asshole, then I wasn't sticking around to be teased.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Where you going," princess?"""" He asked", getting ready to slide out of bed. I ignored the rippling of his muscles and continued to leave his room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm sleeping in a guest room. Don't bother following me."""" I called out behind me", going in a guest room. I heard him hurry out of bed," but I stepped into the room and slammed the door.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64703;""A month and a half passed and I'm closer to my due date. Living with Daxton is literally a pain in the ass"," but since we're """"engaged""""", we sort of have to so we can keep up appearances. Daxton went back to work a few weeks after his accident and I was left alone most of the time. I finally went to tell my parents everything that was going on and they were surprisingly supportive. But the one thing Dax and I haven't talked about were baby names.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ari," come on. I think you've been pushing this to the side for too long now. The baby is due in three weeks and we don't have an idea of what to name him."""" Daxton said", forcing me to sit down next to him on the sofa.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I sighed and sat down slowly," back aching tremendously. Being pregnant was just getting worse and worse and I was so glad that the baby was coming soon. """"Okay"," okay. What are you thinking?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We went back and forth, giving suggestions, but none of them felt like the right name to name our son.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um," Andrew?"""" He suggested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ew," come on your name is Daxton and you want to name your child a basic name?"""" I commented"," rubbing my belly as the baby kicked. """"Yeah", your daddy's full of it," isn't he?"""" I murmured softly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hey," no talking crap to him about me. I don't see you coming up with anything better."""" He retorted", putting his arm behind me. We had grown closer than ever and were officially together, trying to mend things that happened before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I thought for a while and one popped into my head. """"What about Dale? You know"," since it's a combination between my name and yours?"""" I offered and Daxton choked on his drink.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Princess," that sounds like an old lady's name."""" He chuckled when I hit him. """"How about...."""" He paused as he thought about it. """"....Axel. It's still a combination of our names"," but more masculine.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mmmm," but I like the name Dale. I wanna name him too."""" I whined", pouting. Dax groaned and swiped his face.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fine. Dale can be his middle name," how about that?"""" I smiled and nodded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good enough for me. Axel Dale King. Sounds good. Do you like that?"""" I asked", looking up at him. He was staring at me with a slight smile on his face.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's perfect."""" He whispered and leaned down", pressing his lips hard against mine. When he pulled away, I was sorta breathless. It didn't take a lot to get me horny these days and I was always irritated that I couldn't have crazy, wild sex like we always did before. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alright, alright," go to that stupid conference before I jump your bones."""" I pushed Daxton away and he laughed loudly. """"Who has a conference at night anyway?"""" I grumbled", accepting Daxton's hands to pull me up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My dad does."""" Daxton shook his head at the thought. """" I don't even know why he called everyone in. It's not even on the schedule for this month."""" He straightened his tie and I walked with him to the front door.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It shouldn't take too long," right?"""" I wondered", leaning against the door. He smirked, pulling me to his chest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nah," I'll be back in time to...."""" He leaned in a whispered in my ear. """"....make you feel good."""" His hot breath fanned over my neck and I shivered with anticipation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'll be waiting."""" I said", kissing him. He pulled away, winked, and walked to his car, getting in and driving off. I sighed and closed the door, missing him already. I thought about how far we've come and hoped things would only get better from here on out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For the next two hours, I busied myself by sweeping the floors, cleaning and dusting the rooms, and even washed the little bit of dishes that littered the sink. After those exhausting jobs, I poured myself a cup of tea and sat down at the bar, wondering what was taking Daxton so long.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He's not usually out this late."""" I muttered nuder my breath. Just then", my phone vibrated and I looked to see who was texting me this late at night.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dax: Come outside. I have a surprise for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I smiled widely and walked to the front door, wondering what present he had for me this time. I opened the door and walked out into the dark night, eyes scanning the area for Daxton's car. I frowned when I didn't see it and walked to the side, where we parked our other cars. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Looking for somebody?"""" A gravelly voice asked from behind me. I froze", not recognizing the voice. I immediately knew it wasn't Dax that texted me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Where is Dax?"""" I asked", voice shaking a bit. The voice chuckled and I winced at how much he sounded like he needed water running down his throat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Somewhere you'll never find him."""" I moved to turn around to see the guys face"," but I was struck from behind and darkness clouded my vision as I fell the the ground.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64704;""Pain resonated through my head and I groaned", moving my head to the side. My eyes opened and I looked around, noticing I was in a dark room. A small bed was in the corner and water sat next to it. I scrambled over to and and drank greedily, softening my dry throat. After coming up for air, I looked for a way out. The door was wide and I stood up shakily and walked towards it. Suddenly, the door opened.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well, well," well. Our prisoner awakens."""" My eyes widened at the person standing in front of me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sam?"""" I squinted", not believing my eyes. He smirked and waked in, causing me to walk backwards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The one and only. How ya feeling?"""" He asked", as if he was really concerned. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"W-why am I here? Why did you kidnap me?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You see," Rayna wasn't supposed to break up with me. We were supposed to be together forever. And then she told me she cheated on me."""" His voice deepened with slight anger and he clenched his fists.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So why didn't you take Ray? Why take me?"""" I whispered", afraid to say the wrong thing. His eyes swung towards me and he stalked forward, like a predator.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You have money. Your fiancé has money. Lots and lots of money that I need to pay off my debt to the mafia."""" I scrunched up my eyebrows at his testimony.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So you kidnap me?! I'm pregnant, you idiot! As soon as I get out of here," I'm suing the mess out of your ass."""" I threatened. Sam visibly sighed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I was afraid you would say that."""" He swung something and knocked me out for the second time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
* * *,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Come on," bitch. Wake up!"""" A rough voice yelled and I woke up", groggily opening my eyes. A group of men stood around me and I tried to stand up, but my arms were tied behind my back. I was on a wooden chair and my legs were also tied.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wha-- where am I?"""" I asked", looking around. Supplies were scattered all around and clear, large bags of white power was on a table across the room. It looked like a warehouse. A man with a grease stained shirt and crooked teeth came froward and his stale breath made me want to throw up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You're in the house. Now where's the money?"""" I was so confused as to why he thought I had money with me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Money? What money? I don't know what you're talking about."""" A smack rang out and I realized the man smacked me. I gasped as tears sprang to my eyes from the pain. I felt my baby kick and I started to get scared", worried that they would do something to harm him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sam told us you had the money and we want our goddamn money," bitch!"""" He spit out", getting angrier by the second. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just then, a car crashed through the warehouse, making wood splinters to fly everywhere. The men started yelling and grabbing guns, pointing it at the car. Someone cut the ropes from my legs and hands and shoved me up. Daxton came out the car with a large gun and started shooting at the men.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ari," run!"""" He yelled. I didn't think twice as I ran way from the chaos. Gunshots were fired and the noise made my ears pop. Suddenly", I was grabbed from behind and something cold and sharp was pressed against my throat. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Put the gun down or I'll slit her throat."""" The man holding me threatened. Tears flowed down my face as my heart pounded mercilessly from the predicament I was in. Daxton hesitated", not sure what to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do it," Dax. Please."""" I pleaded. I would listen to these men if it meant my baby would be safe. He scowled and slowly put the gun down. He held up his hands to show that he wasn't a threat and one of the other men yanked him forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now, wire twenty million dollars to this account right now," or the girl dies. Then you go after her."""" The guy pointed the gun to Daxton's back and pushed him forward with it. Daxton glanced at me", worry etched in his eyes. I nodded, letting him know that he should do it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Daxton took the machine and started typing quickly. He must of tried to contact someone because the gunman smashed the butt of the gun against Daxton's skull.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No!"""" I screamed", thrashing against my captor. Sam just stood in the back, not trying to help. The man pulled me back and tightened his grip on me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Move again and you die. I'll make sure to stab your precious belly first."""" I gasped repeatedly", a panic attack waiting to happen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ari, calm down. I've got this, okay? Just calm down," baby."""" Daxton soothed from his side of the room. I nodded and tried to calm myself down. A thumping sound came from outside and the men turned around", trying to find the source.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What the hell was that?!"""" One yelled. The door burst open and gunshots came from the new-comer", surprising the drug guys.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Get down! Get down!"""" Yells were tossed and it was obvious they were not prepared for this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fuck this!"""" The man holding me yelled and pushed me forward. I was caught off guard and tripped over a box that was in front of me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arielle! No!"""" Daxton's scream seemed to slow down and everything seemed to be going in slow motion. I knew I wouldn't be able to catch myself and there was nothing I could do but to keep falling. Forward. Closer to the ground. When I made contact with the ground", belly first, the pain didn't register until I rolled onto my back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sounds flowed back into my ears, overwhelmingly and a piercing scream ripped through my throat and hot pain shot through  my womb. I reached up to feel my belly and all I could feel was blood pouring out of me. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No......,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ari! Ari, can you here me? Oh my god, stay with me baby, stay with me," please!"""" Daxton's voice cried into my ear and I felt the life draining out of me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dax?"""" I whispered", turning my head towards him. The pain was overwhelming and it kept coming over and over," every few minutes. That's when I realized I was in labor. """"The baby--""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know. Stay awake," please. An ambulance is on its way. Just stay with me."""" He begged", gripping my hand tightly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dax," the baby--""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The baby will be fine," Ari.""""  My eyelids drooped and I was getting frustrated. He wasn't understanding what I was trying to say.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Listen to me!"""" I rasped. """"The baby is coming."""" His reaction was all I needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh my god. No," it's too early. This can't be happening. Not now!"""" He panicked and I sighed deeply", wanting to just close my eyes and rest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm....so tired....."""" I breathed out", eyelids fluttering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No! No," Ari. You can't go to sleep!"""" Sirens sounded outside and he looked up"," waving his hands. """"Over here!""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Footsteps thundered against the floorboards and bags dropped.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sir," I'm gonna need you to step back."""" The paramedic told Daxton. """"Guys"," we have a pregnant woman with abdominal bleeding."""" He said into his walkie talkie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She's in labor!"""" Daxton yelled", still holding my hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scratch that. Woman in labor with abdominal bleeding. We need to get her to the hospital now before she bleeds out. Two lives are in danger right now."""" He said into the comms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After I was strapped onto the gurney," I couldn't hold my eyelids open any longer.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64705;""Why is it that whenever I come to from passing out", all I feel is pain? That's exactly what I felt as soon as I woke up. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hot, searing, branding pain. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I opened my eyes and white everything blinded me. White walls, white sheets, white tape, white heart monitor....I was totally in the hospital....again. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She's coming to. She should be pushing the baby out anytime now."""" A nurse said. I turned my head towards her", still feeling the weight of tiredness crushing my chest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daxton?"""" I called out", wondering where he was. A hand squeezed mine and I immediately knew it was him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm here."""" A contraction hit me and I gasped. It hit me again and I gritted my teeth", trying to take on the pain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Arielle, you have to start pushing now. When you feel another contraction, push with all you've got," okay."""" The nurse told me. I nodded and when another wave of cramping pain came", I pushed like I was taking a shit. I could feel the baby coming out, slowly but surely and it hurt like a bitch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Agghhhh!"""" I screamed out as I pushed against another contraction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Almost there," sweetie! Just one more big push."""" The nurse encouraged and I pushed with all my might until I felt something slip from between my legs and a piercing cry filled the air. """"It's a boy! Congratulations!""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Exhaustion washed over me," but I wanted to see my baby first before I slipped into the darkness that I was so used to by now. """"May I--"""" I held out my arms", wanting to hold my precious baby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Would you like to cut the cord?"""" The nurse asked Daxton. He nodded", mesmerized by our son. After he cut the umbilical cord, the lady cleaned him up, wrapped him in a blanket and brought him over to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He's so beautiful."""" I whispered as he was placed in my arms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 He was so tiny, I felt like I was gonna break him. His hair was dark brown, almost black like his father's and his eyes were a silvery gray, so much so that it was hard to tell if it was blue or gray in certain lighting. His skin was a light tan color and he stopped crying when he looked at me. Daxton came over and brushed my hair out of my sweaty face.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What's his name?"""" The nurse asked us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Axel."""" I breathed"," not wanting to ever stop looking at my precious baby boy. """"We made him."""" I said", looking up at Daxton, tears clouding my vision. Daxton looked close to tears too, but he sucked them up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He's perfect."""" He leaned forward and kissed my forehead. My eyes closed for a second before opening again. """"Tired?"""" He asked. I nodded", leaning my head back. Daxton pressed a button and the bed moved back," laying flat again. """"Go to sleep"," princess.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Okay."""" I whispered", handing him Axel. Sleep took over me and for the first time, I welcomed the darkness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
* * *,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nine months passed and things were fine for a while. I had to stay in the hospital for a month after having Axel because of the bruising in my abdominal area, the loss of blood, and the early delivery. Everything with Axel was fine and he was a normal baby, thank god, and I couldn't be thankful for anything more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The paparazzi and magazines were going crazy when they saw Axel and we even did an entire family photoshoot for a 10-pafe spread to welcome Axel into the King family. It seemed as if the entire world was just as excited as we were. They interviewed us and even asked if we were going to have another kid. Not anytime soon if I get my way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Daxton was a terrific father and he did everything in his power to be the best dad to Axel. He fed him, went on walks with him, spoke to him as if Axel could understand what he was saying, and even took him to work with him for a while. When I was too tired to get up in the middle of the night to feed him, Daxton was always willing to do that for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then one day, when Axel turned eight months, Daxton started to change. He wasn't as willing to help out with Axel and he always drowned himself in his work, just like today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Daxton," can you watch Axel for a while? I have to go shopping and then go to the gym."""" I asked", grabbing my keys. As soon as I could after Axel was born, I hit the gym religiously and was able to lose all of my baby weight in six months. I still went to keep up my body and stay healthy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just take him with you."""" Daxton said blatantly. I frowned and walked to his desk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can't," Dax. I'm gonna be occupied. You can just bring him here into your office."""" I argued. He sighed and rubbed his temples", as if he had a headache.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I have work.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's the weekend."""" I countered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Doesn't matter."""" He continued. I groaned and threw my hands up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He's your son," dammit! All you have to do is watch him for a couple of hours and then you'll be free of him."""" Daxton raised his piercing green eyes to mine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No."""" He said finally. Hurt must have been etched into my features because his face softened before it hardened again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fine. Bastard."""" I spit out and stormed out of his office. I walked to our room"," where Axel slept and quietly walked over to the bed. Axel was wide awake and mumbling incoherently to himself. """"Hi"," baby. How are you?"""" I asked", picking him up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He smiled and waved his arms, bubbling out words as if he were answering me. A smile automatically appeared on my face and I kissed both his cheeks before positioning him onto my hip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Since your dad is being an as--annoying, we'll just spent the day together," how about that?"""" I asked", Axel, knowing he wouldn't be able to answer me back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daaaa!"""" He squealed", kicking his feet happily. I sighed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah," daaaa."""" I repeatedly", chuckling to myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dadaa!"""" Axel cried out", reaching out behind me. I turned around to see what he was looking at. Daxton stood in the doorway, arms crossed over his chest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We need to talk."""" His deep voice rang out and anticipation littered through my spine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Okay.""""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64706;""""""Okay"," talk."""" I said", adjusting myself on the bed and put Axel on my lap. He started playing with my hair and babbled happily. Daxton walked in, but still stood up. He put his hands in his pockets and pursed his lips before looking at me. I started to worry because he was in his serious mode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Uh...I don't know how to start this."""" He looked up at the ceiling", as if something up there would tell him how to start this conversation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just talk," Dax."""" I urged", wanting to know what he was trying to tell me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You know how, uh," Sam kidnapped you?"""" He asked and a pang shot through my abdomen", reminding me of the horrific experience of being kidnapped. I nodded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jeremy was behind the entire thing."""" My mouth fell open and many different emotions ran through me", not sure which one to feel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You're lying."""" I breathed"," shaking my head. There was no way Jeremy was behind my kidnapping. """"How do you know? Who told you?"""" I questioned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why would I lie," Ari? And I can't tell you that."""" He scratched his head", looking uncomfortable. I started to get mad because there was no way he couldn't tell me who told him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I don't know. Maybe you're jealous of the attention he gave me."""" I shot", standing up with Axel. Daxton laughed humorlessly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jealous? Why would I be jealous when I've gotten what I wanted? I have you and he doesn't. Simple as that.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm not a possession."""" I ground out", wanting to bash his head in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Then stop acting like it.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What?!"""" I yelled"," offended. """"Since when do I act like a possession?"""" Axel made a noise and I looked down at him", seeing his frown. He patted my chest repeatedly, seeming to sense my distress. I kissed the top of his head and I rocked him slightly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Look," I'm not giving you this information because it....."""" He trailed off", setting his lips in a grim line.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because what," Dax?"""" I asked", walking towards him. He shook his head.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nothing. I need to work. Take Axel with you because I'm not watching him."""" He left without another word. My mouth seemed to be off it's hinges because it stayed open at his words. Why was he so moody all of a sudden? I couldn't think of one think that I've done to deserve this treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Already in my work out clothes, I grabbed my purse and the keys and walked out with Axel, making sure to put on my shades. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Arielle," look this way!"""" Camera clicked and I shielded Axel from the prying paps. They just didn't know when to stop. Good thing there was a gate closing off our house. I walked quickly to my car", strapped Axel in, and got in, driving off as fast as I could.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They're relentless," aren't they?"""" I asked Axel", looking at him through the rearview mirror. He smiled and chewed on one of his toys," ignoring me. I sighed. """"Your dad is going to drive me crazy", I swear. We're supposed to get married when you turn one," so thats exciting right?"""" Axel cooed and sputtered", waving his toy in the air. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I smiled, knowing he couldn't answer me. After doing the shopping, I drove to the local gym. When I got in," I strapped Axel into a bouncy chair so that he could """"exercise"""" too. Whenever he moved", the contraption bounced him up and down repeatedly while he kicked his legs. Two hours later, Axel was sleeping and I was tired from my intense workout.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I was walking out the building with Axel when I bumped into someone. """"Oh"," I'm so sorry!""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's okay--Ari?"""" I looked at the man in front of me and smiled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jeremy! Hi! I feel like I haven't seen you in forever."""" He smiled at me", but it didn't reach his eyes like it used to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hey," how are you?"""" He asked. I shrugged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ehh," I'm alright. Just going home to crash. How about you?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Same. I'm thinking of moving again," but I'm not sure."""" He looked at Axel and his eyes lit up. """"So this is your little bugger?"""" I nodded as he walked behind me to see Axel's sleeping face. """"Wow"," he looks just like...Daxton."""" He hesitated when he said Daxton's name.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah, I get that all the time. He has Daxton's face, height, and hair, and my nose," eyes and chin. Fifty-fifty.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Congratulations. Uh, I gotta go," but it was nice catching up with you.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You too."""" I watched as he went into the gym and I turned back to go to my car. the drive home was silent", besides Axel's soft breathing. I started thinking about the conversation Daxton and I had earlier and I frowned. Why would he react like that all of a sudden?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I got home, I breathed a sigh of relief. It was starting to get dark and I just wanted to relax. I placed Axel on me and Daxton's large bed and stripped to take a quick shower. After the shower, I put of a long t-shirt and shorts and went to look for Daxton.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Babe! We're home!"""" I yelled", walking down the stairs to Daxton's office. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I got there, I knocked, not sure if he was on a conference call. When there was no answer, I opened the door slowly and gasped. It was totally empty. Not even a speck of dust was left. The only thing in the room was a desk and two chairs. All of his books were gone, along with the pictures with me and him, and Axel in them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daxton?"""" I called out"," wondering why his office was empty. I started to get worried when I searched the entire house and still couldn't find him. I went back to our room and looked in the closet. All of his clothes were gone. """"No..."""" I ran to the bathroom and everything that belonged to him was also gone there too. It was as if he had disappeared from the house. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Seriously..."""" I mumbled to myself. I pulled out my phone and called him. """"This better be a joke."""" After ringing for a while",a new sound burst into my ear followed by this message:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We're sorry. The number you have called has been disconnected. Please call your service provider for any questions you might have. For more options press--,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I ended the call and squeezed my phone, not believing this was happening. Why would he disconnect his phone? It was working earlier so this was recent. I sat at the edge of the bed and sighed, running my fingers through my hair. From the corner of my eye, I saw a folded sheet of paper. I reached out and unfolded it slowly. It was from Daxton.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dear Arielle, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
     If you're reading this, that means I'm gone. Gone as in not coming back. Gone as in you won't have to put up with my shit anymore. You're most likely wondering why I left without notice. I've been planning this for a while ever since Axel was born. It's not you, it's me. Cliché, right? But I'm being very serious. My presence has been and will continue to put you and Axel in danger and I don't want to lose the only two people in the world that I care for with all my heart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By the time I read this much, pools of tears were streaming down my face.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
     You were kidnapped because of bad business that occurred between me and other people that I will not name. The less you know the better. you can be as angry as you want with me as long as you're safe. I've cut all contact with you and any other people that might know you, including Rayna and Marco. It will be as if I didn't even come into your lives. It is bette this way. I love you and Axel so much and I regret that I will not be able to be there to watch Axel grow up, but I know you will take care of him as best as you can. Do not try to contact me and keep Axel safe, no matter what.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Much love,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daxton King""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64707;""""""Mommy!"""" Axel ran out his grandparents house and towards my outstretched arms. I scooped him up", peppering kisses all over his face.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hi," baby! Did you have fun with grandma?"""" I asked", putting him back down. For a four year old, he was really tall. Just like his......his dad. I pushed away the thought immediately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes! We baked cookies and a BIG cake--"""" He opened his arms wide when he said big. """"--and we read a lot of books."""" Axel explained", his dark hair falling into his eyes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He behaved himself very well. Reminds me of Daxton at that age."""" Mrs. King came out with an apron on. I smiled through the pain that squeezed my chest. Ever since Axel was born", my relationship with Daxton's mother became less and less rocky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm not surprised."""" I chuckled"," grabbing his little hand. """"Say bye to grandma.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bye," grandma!"""" He waved vigorously behind him as we walked to the car. """"See you tomorrow!""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I drove off to our house and grabbed his book bag before opening the front door. Axel zoomed in, excited to tell me something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ax," what do you do when you come through the front door?"""" I asked. He slinked back", a sly smile on his face.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Take off my shoes. Sorry," mommy."""" He apologized while unlacing his shoes and slipping them off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's okay. Just remember next time."""" ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I have to show you the picture I drew in class."""" Axel grabbed my hand and dragged me into the kitchen. I chuckled and let him lead me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay, okay. This must be important," huh?"""" I asked", when he let me go and dug through his book bag. He nodded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Very important. We had to draw family pictures and mine was the best! Miss. Johnson even said so herself."""" He said proudly"," yanking out the portrait. He put it on the kitchen counter and kneeled down on the chair to get to my height. """"Do you like it"," mommy?"""" He asked. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I nodded, gazing at the beautiful picture. There were three people in the drawing. I was first and he drew me with long yellow hair and blue filled-in circles for my eyes. He was the second one, obviously, because he was the shortest. He drew himself with shaggy dark hair and silver eyes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who's the last person," Ax?"""" I wondered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's Daxton! My daddy!"""" He said excitedly. My heart clenched and just the mention of his name made me want to go and cry forever in my room. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the drawing, Daxton was a giant, towering over both of us. He had long hair that reached the back of his neck and bright green eyes. In the background was a big house, six cars, and a pet dog. He drew the sun in the corner of the paper and the clouds were shaped like disfigured cotton balls.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"His eyes..."""" I whispered", touching the drawing as if I could touch him though that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You said his eyes were really green so I used the greenest green ever!"""" Axel frowned suddenly. """"When do I get to meet my daddy? All the other kids have daddies and I don't."""" He pouted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I closed my eyes," trying to think of what to tell him. """"You will meet him one day."""" Was all I could say.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay. I'm hungry," mommy. Let's eat some cake!"""" The topic of Daxton was quickly forgotten", thank god, and now his second favorite subject, food, was on his mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um," no sweetie. You can have cake after you eat your dinner. Wanna help me cook?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes, yes," yes! Can we cook mac and cheese? Please mommy please?"""" He begged. Mac and cheese was his favorite....just like his dad. I nodded and smiled when he jumped for joy. """"Whoa."""" He caught on to the counter when he almost fell off the chair doing his victory dance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Be careful," baby."""" I called", taking out the macaroni from the pantry. It took about thirty minutes to cook the entire meal, which consisted of mac and cheese, broccoli, and pieces of steak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mmmmm vis ish foohhhh goooo."""" Axel said with a mouthful of food.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ax," don't talk with food in your mouth. You could choke. What do you want to drink with this?"""" I asked", getting up to go to the fridge. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Axel made sure to swallow his food before answering. """"Fruit punch!"""" He took another big bite of his food", munching happily. I handed him his drink and devoured my food. I looked up when I heard Axel giggling uncontrollably.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What?"""" I asked", smirking. He pointed at me, laughing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You're eating too fast," mommy. Take your time. You tell me that everyday."""" He found that to be hilarious. He even pounded on the table. He brushed his hair out of his eyes and grinned. """"Race ya upstairs?"""" Before I could move", he took off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oh no you don't!"""" I yelled", running after him. He squealed and took off upstairs, towards my room. I followed closely behind him and when I caught up, I scooped him from the ground.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mommy! You caught me!"""" He screamed with delight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sure did!"""" I blew on his belly and jumped on the large bed with him in my arms. He was laughing so hard", his face was turning red.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You win," you win!"""" He giggled", giving up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh," yeah. Uh huh I won."""" I got up and did a happy dance", swinging my hips around in a circle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I can do that too. Watch."""" Axel jumped off the bed and started mocking me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Last one to brush their teeth is a rotten egg."""" I said", racing to the bathroom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No fair! You got a head start!"""" Axel whined padding behind me into the bathroom. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay," here."""" I put toothpaste on both of our brushes and handed Axel's his. """"Ready", set," go!"""" We both brushed vigorously", trying to get every corner and trying to win at the same time. Axel spit in the sink, washed his hands, and ran out, jumping on my bed. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I win, I win! You lose," mommy."""" His hair flew as he continued to jump", grey eyes shining with happiness. I smiled at him before finishing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alright," time for bed little one."""" I walked to him and he jumped into my arms. I stumbled back a bit and carried him to his room next door. He had everything from the headboard to the dressers with The Flash on it. He was obsessed. I put him down and he ran to his bed", getting under the covers. After I came and tucked him in, he grabbed my hand before I left.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wanna know who I'm gonna dream about tonight?"""" He asked softly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Me?"""" I joked", chuckling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No. I'm gonna dream of daddy.""""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I heard the bell ring and I watched as little kids filed out of the elementary prep school. I could see that uniforms were mandatory because every kid that walked out of there wore the same thing. My eyes scanned the grass area, searching. Then, one kid stood out from the others. Though he was young, he was a little bit taller than his peers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
His hair was dark and long, curling under his ears. Even from where I stood, I could see his piercing silver eyes. That was definitely my son. I watched as he walked in my direction, saying bye to one of his friends. I called my mother before, telling her that I was going to pick him up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always maintained contact with my parents and told them not to tell Arielle. I closed my eyes, thinking and remembering my fiancé. When I opened my eyes, I saw that my son stopped in front of me, waiting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Are you gonna move?"""" He asked", straining his neck to look me in the eyes. I knelt down in front of him, smirking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Are you always this rude?"""" I asked", scanning his body. He seemed healthy and smart. Arielle did good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My mommy says to not talk to strangers. So move," giant."""" When I didn't move"," he raised his foot. """"I'll kick you and scream.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No, wait," wait."""" I laughed. Of course his mother taught him that. """"What's your name?"""" He squinted and thought about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Only if you give me your name too. And then move."""" He bargained. Smart boy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Deal."""" I extended my hand and he shook it firmly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My name is Axel. What's yours?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daxton. My name is Daxton."""" Axel's eyes widened.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That's my daddy's name!"""" He said excitedly. He looked me up and down", stopping at my hair. He reached forward," gripping the long locks. """"He has long hair like you too.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Really," now?"""" I was surprised Arielle told Axel about me. I thought she would've told him I died or something. He nodded vigorously and then actually looked me in the eye. He gasped and placed both of his hands on my cheeks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Your eyes are so green. Just like my drawing!"""" This kid was a happy one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What drawing?"""" I asked", hesitantly placing my hands over his. I couldn't believe this was child. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My family picture of me, mommy," and daddy."""" Suddenly he leaned forward"," close to my ear. """"Are you my daddy?"""" He whispered. He looked at me expectantly. I nodded slowly. He squealed and launched his tiny body into my large frame. """"I finally found you!""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I chuckled and wrapped my arms around him, closing my eyes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wait."""" He pulled away slightly. """"What's my mommy's name? Her whole name? Mommy said you're the only person in the world", besides grandma and grandpa," that know all of her name. And me."""" He pointed to his chest. I smiled. This was too easy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arielle Nalani Renata Dabria Fortunato."""" The Italian name flowed smoothly off my tongue and Axel's jaw dropped.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You are my daddy!"""" He wrapped his arms around me again and tears sprang to my eyes. This was all I needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arielle's P.O.V:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I got home from work, I was exhausted. I ate a quick snack and went upstairs to change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mommy! I found Daddy!"""" I heard Axel's voice and I frowned. He wasn't supposed to be home yet. I sighed when I comprehended what he said. He always tried to find a man that looked like his father.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Baby," what are you doing home?"""" I jogged down the stairs. """"And what do you mean you found your da--"""" My jaw fell open when I saw who Axel was holding hands with. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Daxton looked a bit uncomfortable and I couldn't stop the reaction I had towards him, even after all these years. His hair was longer, falling flawlessly over his shoulders and his beard was grown out more than usual, but edged perfectly, framing his plump pink lips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was in one of his tailor made Armani suits and I just wanted to run my hands down his muscular arms. But then I snapped out of my stupor and pain from his sudden appearance resonated throughout my body. I had to reach deeply, but the ache was still there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arielle."""" His deep voice called out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daxton."""" I breathed", not trusting my voice fully. I couldn't separate the different feelings rushing through me. Anger, lust, want, hurt, pain...especially pain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You look good."""" He commented", gesturing to my body. I nodded and Axel looked between both of us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mommy," can he stay today? Please??"""" Axel pleaded", clutching his father's hand tightly. My heart went out to him and I knew he needed his dad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sure. Why don't you go and put your things up while I speak to your father," okay?"""" ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Axel ran towards me and nodded, giving me a big hug. I kissed the top of his head and patted his behind as he scurried upstairs. When I was sure he was our of earshot, I turned back to Daxton.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What are you doing here," Daxton?"""" I asked", crossing my arms over my chest. He shuffled his feet and ran his fingers though his long hair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I--uh," I wanted to see Axel.....and you."""" He looked at me with those piercing green eyes that haunted me for four and half years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bullshit! You had four years to see us and you come now? Now??"""" My voice got higher as I got frustrated. """"You left us Daxton. Axel wasn't even old enough to remember you and now you wanna swoop in and play dad? That's not gonna work with me.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You left me! the tabloids attacked me", saying I drove you away, I wasn't good enough," or that you weren't ready to settle down and have a family. You know how long I cried? Two years! Two fucking years before I figured out it would be better to forget you instead of cry over a self-centered selfish prick---"""" ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I broke down, unable to finish my rant. I felt his arms wrap around me as I sobbed my heart out, releasing everything that I held in for all these years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Daxton rubbed my back and leaned his chin on the top of my head. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm so sorry."""" He whispered.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64709;""My heart almost stops as I take in the utter disaster before me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Twisted metal.  Flashing lights.  Desperation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Flames leap out of the wreckage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A scream breaks through the noise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A woman pulled out of the crash--,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No, a mother.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She doesn't try to escape the flames;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She tries to dive back in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She's crying, yelling one word over and over again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Repeating a name like an anthem, a prayer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A police officer is holding her back, looking like his job is to hold the weight of the world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Firefighters work to put out he flames, eventually lifting the car enough to look inside.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The commotion increases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The firefighter reaches into the burned and warped metal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The mother cries out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A young child--a girl.  No more than 4 years old.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yellow rain-jacket and pink boots.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Teddy bear in hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not a single scratch.  Not a single burn.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only blue eyes wide and calm as she reaches out for her mother.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The crowd gathered can only gasp in shock, then stand silently or cry with joy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The mother can't even speak, only hold her daughter like she'll never let go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Standing on that sidewalk in the face of a disaster," I saw God.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64710;""I crave it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The desire overwhelming and overpowering me. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I retire to bed, I dream of it. No one else can have it but me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If anyone else has it, I MUST have it also.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As I walk by the glass window, I salivate, my hands itching to grab hold ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of the beauty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"64712;""""""Mommy."""" I sniffed and wiped my face before turning to face Axel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes," baby?"""" He slowly walked down the stairs", eyes flitting between me and Daxton. He had changed out of his uniform and was wearing a flash t-shirt and dark jeans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why are you crying?"""" His face scrunched up", worried. I walked over to him and picked him up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't worry about it, okay? Mommy is fine. Why don't you," uh--"""" I glanced at Daxton"," who was eyeing us silently. """"--go play with daddy while I make you a snack."""" Axel's eyes lit up and he nodded quickly", scrambling to get out of my arms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He ran to his father," excited. """"What do you wanna do? We can play in the yard"," or in the front and play basketball or--"""" I smiled a bit and walked away", letting him stay with his dad for a while.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I walked to the kitchen, wondering what type of snack I should make for Axel. Since I'm a health nut, I decided to make a fruit salad. I got out a copious amount of fruits and a large, clear plastic bowl. While I washed and cut up the fruits, I thought about Daxton. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why was he here? Out of the blue, he wants to meet Axel? I just didn't believe that. I waited for him, thinking he would realize that he couldn't live without me, but that obviously wasn't the case. Emotions washed over me and my heart squeezed painfully. I breathed out ruggedly, trying not to cry again. I could feel a panic attack coming on and I felt my throat closing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ari," Axel wants to know if he can--"""" Daxton rushed over to my side. """"Are you okay?"""" He put his hand on my shoulder and I shrugged it off", not wanting to feel his touch at the moment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm fine. What do you need?"""" I sucked in a breath and calmed myself down as much as I could. Green eyes looked at me hesitantly", not believing that I was fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uh," Axel wants one of his basketballs. Do you know where he keeps them?"""" Daxton asked. I pointed downstairs to the basement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Same place you kept your tools."""" I told him", going back to chopping up fruit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thanks."""" I nodded", not looking at him. It was going to be a long night if he was going to stay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mommy," can daddy tuck me in?"""" I raised my eyebrows. He was already on a 'daddy' name calling status with Daxton? That didn't take long at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Next time," okay?"""" He nodded and I fixed his covers around his body"," making sure he wouldn't be cold that night. """"Did you have fun today?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh," yes! Daddy's good at basketball. He dunked!"""" Axel's silver eyes were wide with surprise as he told his story. A faint smile brushed my lips as I listened to him. I didn't ever remember him being this excited about playing sports until now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well," I'm glad you enjoyed yourself. Now time to sleep. You have school in the morning."""" I kissed his forehead and got up to turn off his light.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Are you and daddy gonna get married now," mommy?"""" Axel whispered. I froze in the doorway", chest hurting from his innocent words.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I don't know."""" I finally answered. Axel didn't say anything after that", so I left his door open a little and then walked next door to my room. When I got in there, I sighed and started taking off my clothes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arielle."""" I screamed and covered my chest with my shirt as Daxton came into view.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What are you doing in here? Get out!"""" I pointed to the door and walked backwards and around him as he came closer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is my room too," Ari.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No, it was your room. You left," so it's mine now. Go sleep on the couch downstairs."""" Daxton stopped walking", perplexed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Well I need a blanket.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm sure you'll manage without one. Now leave."""" I pointed to the door again"," hoping he would listen. """"Please"," Dax."""" I whispered at the end", voice breaking. Daxton's face softened and he nodded slowly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If that's what you want."""" I didn't answer him because I was afraid my voice would crack again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I closed my eyes and waited for him to leave, not opening them again until I heard my bedroom door close. When it did, I took a quick shower, changed into my pjs and hopped into my cold bed. So many memories lay in this bed and I jus couldn't understand why I couldn't stop the feelings that I had for Daxton. I went to sleep and didn't have one dream for the first time since Daxton left.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
* * *,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The sun hit my eyes and I groaned, not wanting to get out of bed. Wait.....the sun? I opened my eyes and shot out of bed, wondering why I was seeing the sun. I always woke up at 4:00am to get ready and it was always dark around that time. I looked at my clock and saw that it read 11:45am.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shit! Axel's gonna be late for school."""" I ran out my room and burst into Axel's room. He wasn't there"," but his bed was made. That's when I went into panic mode. """"Axel?""""I called out", running down the stairs," heart pounded furiously. """"Axel"," where are you?!""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I took him to school."""" I skidded to a halt when Daxton appeared from the kitchen. I lost my ability to breathe when I saw that he didn't have a shirt on. His washboard abs and deep v-line called my name. His long hair was ruffled as if he just woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why the hell would you do that?!"""" I yelled"," snapping out of my stupor. """"He's not your responsibility and I was perfectly capable of doing that myself.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I never said you couldn't do it. You were sleeping so peacefully," so I decided to take the burden off of you."""" Daxton explained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Axel is not a buden."""" I said darkly", offended.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I didn't mean that--"""" He sputtered", trying to correct himself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Save it. Don't think that you can come in here after four years and swoop in to be the perfect dad. It doesn't work like that."""" I walked past him and into the kitchen to find something to eat. I heard his footsteps behind me as he followed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How about I tell you why I left."""" I opened my mouth to answer smartly"," but he beat me to it. """"The whole reason why I left. You deserve that much."""" He said", pleading with his eyes. I sighed and sat down in a chair the was by the island.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Go ahead.""""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64713;""""""I left because you and Axel's lives were in danger. Because of me."""" Daxton explained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Okay. And you couldn't tell me that? I am--was your fiancé and you couldn't explain this to me?"""" I argued"," not accepting that excuse. I leaned off the counter and went to the fridge to find something to eat. """"You can go back to wherever the hell you came from because Axel and I will be fine without you. Like we have for the past four years.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ari--"""" Daxton started but I interrupted him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No, Daxton! Dammit," you can't just come here and expect me to forgive you just because--""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lance, Jeremy," and Sam were behind everything."""" I froze when he said that. Lance? My ex-boyfriend?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You're lying."""" I breathed"," not wanting to believe that Jeremy or Lance had something to do with what Daxton was talking about. """"I saw Jeremy the day you left and he was nice to me. There's no way he had anything to do with this. He hasn't even bothered me since you were gone."""" I turned to face Daxton", arms crossed over my chest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He sighed deeply. """"That day"," Jeremy killed two people."""" My jaw fell open. What? """"He's been in prison since I left"," that's why he hasn't been in contact with you."""" I shook my head", baffled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How do I know you're telling the truth?"""" I asked", secretly starting to believe him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You didn't think Sam was capable of something like kidnapping you, but he did? No one's perfect," Ari."""" Daxton explained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay," but that still doesn't explain why you left. We could've all left together. Gone out of the country. Something."""" I started to get angry again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They said that if I didn't leave you and Axel," they would kill you both."""" I gasped at his words. Were they really that ruthless? I blinked many times and covered my mouth", leaning against the counter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oh my god...."""" I whispered to myself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I know."""" He answered. I shook my head.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No," Daxton. I found..."""" I gulped. """"A few days before you left"," I found the email Jeremy sent to you. But I thought--"""" Tears burned my eyes"," but didn't fall. I couldn't believe he was behind this entire thing. """"Wait", but if he knew you were gone and didn't mess with me all these year," why did you come back?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I--"""" He started talking", but then a horrifying thought came to my mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you're back," what if they saw you take Axel to school?"""" I started to freak out and grabbed my keys. Daxton grabbed my wrist", pulling me back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wait," you don't know that."""" I yanked my wrist out of his hand angrily.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Are you crazy?! I'm not gonna sit here and speculate when our son could be in danger!"""" I moved past him and ran out the front door and into my car. I didn't care if Daxton followed or not. I just needed to get to Axel. I drove as fast as I could to Axel's school", running red lights and all. When I reached his school, I hopped out my car and was about to run into the building when I saw a man and a little boy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That little boy had dark hair and the man was whispering something to him. The little boy frowned and tried to yank his hand out of the man's larger one, but the man gripped tighter and scooped him up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No! Let me go! Help!"""" The little boy screamed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Axel!"""" I yelled"," recognizing that scream. The man spotted me and started running with my baby. """"No!"""" I sprinted after the man", but I wasn't fast enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mommy!"""" Axel screamed", reaching out towards me. I was breathing hard and tears streamed down my face. I couldn't lose him too. I just couldn't. Just when I was about to collapse from exhaustion, a man came out of and tackled the man that had Axel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fists flew and Axel scrambled away from the two men and ran towards me. I ran and fell to the grass hugging him tightly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh my god," I thought I was gonna lose you!"""" Axel gripped me tight", shaking violently. I wiped his face and searched his body, making sure he was okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who was that man," Mommy?"""" Axel whispered", clinging to me, scared. His eyes flitted all around, as if looking for someone else to come out and take him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't know," baby. I don't know."""" I looked over at the men and saw the man that tried to kidnap Axel run away to his car and drove off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hey! Is your kid okay?"""" The stranger jogged over", rubbing his bruised knuckles. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Are you fine," Axel?"""" I asked"," quietly and he nodded vigorously. """"Yes"," he's okay. Thank you so much."""" The man brushed it off and knelt beside me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh," it was nothing."""" He smiled at me and I was mesmerized by his beauty. His hair was golden blonde and he had light brown eyes. His teeth were crystal white and judging by the tailored suit he was wearing", he obviously came from money.  I scoffed when I realized who he was. He was one of the men that worked in Daxton's building. I met him before, but never really held a long conversation with him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nothing? I almost lost my son and you say that's nothing?"""" I looked at his hands. """"You even bruised yourself."""" He chuckled and looked at his hands for a second before looking back at me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well," I guess it was something. I'm just glad both of you are okay."""" ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What do you say," Ax?"""" I asked Axel. He turned to the man and grinned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thank you for saving me Mister."""" He held out his tiny hand and the man smiled back"," shaking Axel's small hand. """"What's your name?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Michael. Michael Ginobli."""" Michael answered. I smiled at the exchange.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm Axel and this is my mommy," Arielle. But I call her mommy."""" Axel said proudly and Michael laughed loudly. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oh I know who you guys are. Always in those magazines. But I don't read them. My daughter always does."""" He shuddered as if it disgusted him and a faint smile appeared on my face. Finally someone who wasn't obsessed with my family.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How old is your daughter?"""" I wondered", standing up and dusting the grass off of my legs. Michael did the same and I had to lean my head back to look him in the eye. He seemed to be around Daxton's height. What is it with me and tall men?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She's four. But reads like and eight-year-old. She mostly looks at you guys' pictures though."""" He shook his head. """"Smart little girl."""" An idea popped into my head and I spoke before I could stop myself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why don't we get together for a playdate? It'll be my way of thanking you.""""  Michael cocked an eyebrow and I blushed. """"Not us"," of course. Axel and--"""" I trailed off", not knowing his daughter's name. Michael smirked at me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Natalie. And sure," why not? Your place or mines?"""" He asked", looking at his watch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mine. How does three sound?"""" He handed me his phone and I typed my number and address into it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perfect. See you then. It was nice meeting you," Axel."""" He looked at me. """"Arielle."""" The way he said my name made me want to melt into a puddle", but restrained myself. I was too old to be acting like this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You too Michael."""" I answered and Axel waved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bye Michael!"""" He shouted as Michael made his way to his luxury car. He winked and drove off"," leaving me wondering if I should take advantage of this once in a life time opportunity.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64714;""""""What happened? Why is Axel home early?"""" Daxton rushed to the front door when we stepped inside. I rolled my eyes at him. Oh", now he wants to be worried?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daddy!"""" Axel launched himself at Daxton and Daxton caught him flawlessly", spinning him around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hey," slugger. Wanna tell me why you aren't in school?"""" Axel nodded and slithered out of Daxton's arms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some man tried to take me and Michael swooped in and punched him so fast," like Flash!"""" Axel told his dad excitedly. """"And mommy saved me too. Now me and Natalie--that's Michael's daughter and she's my age--we have a playdate!"""" Axel jumped up and down with excitement", making me smile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What?"""" Daxton looked up at me"," alarmed. """"Someone tried to kidnap him? Why didn't you say something?"""" He asked", frowning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Axel just did."""" I said smartly"," brushing past him. I didn't have time for his bullshit. """"Michael's coming later. You remember him?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Michael Ginobli?"""" Daxton asked"," turning to face me. I nodded and tossed my keys on the table. Daxton's gaze darkened with anger and grabbed his jacket and moved to walk out the door. """"I gotta go.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Don't bother coming back. Find somewhere else to crash."""" I called out", hoping he heard me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mommy," why are you so mean to Daddy?"""" Axel asked", hopping onto the chair in the kitchen. I breathed a laugh at his question.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He's--difficult to get along with.  You hungry?"""" Axel nodded and I went to get him something to eat before settling down and eating breakfast myself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
* * *,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hours later, while we were watching another episode of the Flash, the doorbell rang. Axel jumped up, overly excited.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They're here!"""" He yelled"," racing to the front door and opening it. """"Michael!"""" Axel's voice carried over into the living room and I got up", bones cracking slightly from sitting down for too long. I heard Michael's voice coming closer and I met up with them halfway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I almost lost my breath when I saw him. He had on dark jeans and a plain white t-shirt that stretched over his large muscles. I bet his ass looked good too. I shook my head, banishing those thoughts. He smiled when he saw me and held up ice cream and cones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I hope this is alright. I brought three different flavors just in case."""" He said innocently and I giggled. Really Ari? Get it together. I told myself. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's fine," Michael. And who's this pretty little girl?"""" I asked", bending down to look at Natalie. She smiled shyly and waved at me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm Arielle. What's your name?"""" I asked her", even though I already knew her name.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Natalie."""" She whispered. She looked exactly like her dad", with her golden hair and brown eyes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hi! I'm Axel. Wanna go play with my toys? I have a toy room!"""" Axel got in front of me and started talking rapidly to the girl. Her eyes widened", but she nodded and Axel took her hand and led her upstairs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well," I guess it's just the two of us."""" Michael said finally", after watching his daughter leave with my son. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Guess so. I'll show you where to put those."""" I pointed to the ice cream and led him to the kitchen. When I got to the freezer", I turned around and bounced off Michael's hard chest, not knowing he was so close behind me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whoa there."""" Michael caught me and I laughed nervously. He pulled me up and our faces were close to each other. I looked down at his plump lips and then at his eyes", breathing fast. I wanted to kiss him so badly, right then, right there. His lips were so close and if I leaned forward just a little bit...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Um," the ice cream."""" I whispered", ignoring my screaming hormones and he seemed to snap out of his hungry daze. He cleared his throat and released me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sorry. Here you go."""" He handed me the ice cream and backed up", leaving plenty of space between us. I put the ice cream in the freezer and grabbed the wine, pouring to glasses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Here. We can go in the living room....and talk?"""" It came out like a question and Michael smiled", grabbing the glass out my hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sure. Lead the way."""" We walked to the living room and sat down on the couch", giving a respectable distance between us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For the next two hours, we talked about our lives, laughing and actually having a good time. At one point, we called the kids down to eat ice cream and after that, they ran back up stairs to play some more. Natalie was warming up to Axel and you would've thought they were siblings. I learned that Natalie's mom died two years ago. He was thirty years old, and he loved to travel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I felt comfortable enough to tell him about the situation between me and Daxton and I swear he almost crushed his glass, he was so angry at Daxton.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No woman should be treated that way."""" He commented", shaking his head after I told him my story. I agreed, but what was done had been done. During our conversation, Michael and I gravitated to each other to the point where our sides were touching and his arm was behind my head, comfortably. And I didn't mind one bit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ari?"""" I froze", hearing Daxton's voice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shit."""" I whispered", leaning my head back. Daxton just had to come back now. I thought I told him not to come back here. I heard Daxton's footsteps walk towards the living room and his eyes landed on me and Michael.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What are you doing?"""" He asked darkly", looking at where Michael's arm was and how close we were.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Having a drink. Didn't I tell you to go find somewhere else to crash?"""" I asked", getting up. His green eyes flashed with anger and he glared at Michael.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Didn't know you were sleeping around already," Ari."""" He sneered and I gasped. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Look, buddy," that wasn't called for."""" Michael's deep voice rang out and he stood up", getting in front of me to face Daxton. They were the same height, but Michael was more muscular.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't buddy me," Michael. Going after my girl already? You always seem to take what's not yours."""" Daxton spit out", getting closer to Michael's face. I had a feeling that statement had a double meaning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not your girl," Daxton. And you need to leave. Now."""" I said firmly", not playing around. Daxton swung his eyes to me and I flinched at the hate that filled that. He laughed harshly, shaking his head.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And to think I came back for you."""" He said nastily. """"You're right. Axel will be fine without me. Have fun with my sloppy seconds."""" He said to Michael and that hit me hard. Unwanted tears welled up in my eyes at his harsh words and I turned around", trying not to cry in front of him. I heard Daxton's footsteps retreat and when I heard the door close, I broke down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hey," hey don't listen to him. He's an asshole. I see what you were talking about."""" Michael wrapped his arms around me", trying to calm me down. I sniffed back some tears and looked up at him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But what about Axel? He's only known his father for two days and now he's gone again. He needs his dad and--"""" My voice broke and I covered my mouth", shaking my head at the fact that Axel would be fatherless again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Forget about Daxton. He's not worth your tears. Hey," look at me."""" Michael brought my face back up"," cupping my cheek. """"You're a strong woman and you deserve the best. Don't let him stop you from being the best mother you possibly can"," okay?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I nodded, sniffing again. Why couldn't all men be like Michael?  I wondered as he wiped my tears away with his thumb. BeforeI could stop myself, I pulled him and crushed my lips against his. My emotions were all over the place and it caused me to do rash things. Michael froze for a few seconds but gave in and kissed me back just as hard. I groaned and threaded my fingers through his hair, bringing him closer. His lips were like a drug I'd never had before and I was loving it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
His arms slipped around my hips and he pulled me against him. We stumbled back onto the couch and he fell on top of me. I wrapped my legs around his waist and brought his hips to mine. Michael groaned from the friction I caused.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mommy!""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daddy!"""" We pulled apart quickly", hearing our children call us. I blushed furiously and scrambled up, moving away from Michael.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oh my god..""""  I touched my swollen lips", embarrassed. Michael's cheeks were flushed and his eyes were hooded as he caught his breath. The tent in his pants were an indication that we were a little bit too into that kiss.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ew you were kissing!"""" Axel cried out", and him and Natalie giggled uncontrollably.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm sorry. I-I don't know what came over me and--""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's okay. Trust me."""" Michael winked at me and my stomach flopped as my cheeks burned again. I smoothed my hair down and nodded. """"Ready to go?"""" He asked Natalie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes! Can we come here again," Daddy? I had fun."""" Natalie asked. Michael and Axel looked at me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh! Uh," of course. You guys are welcome anytime."""" I told them and Axel and Natalie jumped for joy. Michael walked over to me as the kids raced to the front door.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We should do this again."""" He said"," gazing down at me. """"Without the kids of course."""" My breath caught.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Are you asking me out," Michael?"""" I asked", raising an eyebrow. Instead of answering me, he kissed me. When he pulled away," I was breathless again. """"I'm taking that as a yes."""" He nodded and made a phone motion with his hand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Call me."""" He mouthed and I laughed at his childishness. I walked him to the front door and waved as he left with his daughter. When they were gone"," I shut the door and closed my eyes. What a night.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64715;""It had been month and Michael and I kept in touch everyday. We were getting closer and I liked that", but I was also scared of getting too close. It never failed with me and guys. I get close and then I lose them, or get treated like shit. Daxton: King of Assholes, and Jeremy.....well he was just questionable, period. Daxton didn't bother to come around anymore, but sometimes showed up to take Axel somewhere and then disappeared again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Axel was used to not seeing his dad, and it didn't even bother him because Michael somehow became another father figure for him. Everyday after school, he went to Michael's house to play with Natalie because I didn't trust my house anymore. In fact, it wasn't even my house. It was still in Daxton's name and I planned on moving out soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was just sitting in my office, stressed to the max," when a knock sounded on my door. """"Come in!"""" I called out. My assistant", Sarah, peeped her head in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A man is out here asking for you."""" She said. """"He's hot."""" She whispered loudly and I laughed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Well tell him I'm busy and to leave ."""" I reported and she nodded. I went back to writing up my reports when I heard a commotion outside my office.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No! She said to leave!"""" Sarah's voice cried out and my office door opened for the second time. Michael walked in"," flowers in his hand. A smile automatically appeared on my face and I got up to approach him. """"I'm sorry", Ari," he wouldn't listen."""" Sarah apologized.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's okay, Sarah. Whenever he comes," you can let him in."""" She nodded and winked at me before leaving again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So you want me to leave," huh?"""" Michael said", smirking. I bit my lip and slinked up to him, grabbing his tie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now why would I want that?"""" I asked"," cocking my head before bringing his head down to kiss him. Our tongues battled and my eyes closed at the wonderful feeling of his lips on mine. It never failed. He always left me breathless when we parted. """"Are these for me?"""" I asked", eyeing the flowers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mhmm."""" Michael answered", kissing down my neck. I gasped when he bit me slightly, sending a shock straight to my core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Michael!"""" I squealed", pushing him away playfully. If he continued, we would be doing more than kissing in this office. He grinned, dimples indenting his cheeks. God, he was beautiful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sorry, sorry. Here. I know you don't like flowers since they're gonna die anyway," so I got you fake ones."""" I laughed and took the flowers", sniffing them. They had a perfume scent and it filled my nostrils.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I love them."""" I looked up at him and he pulled me close.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm glad. Now you're coming with me."""" I frowned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What? But I have to work."""" He took the flowers out my hand and laid them on my desk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not anymore you don't. You're coming with me and we're going out.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But I--""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No buts. You need a break. You work too hard."""" I opened my mouth to protest again"," but he pouted playfully. """"Please"," Ari? For me?"""" I groaned loudly and shook my head", chuckling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fine! Let me get my jacket."""" His raised his arms with victory and twirled his hips around"," dancing. """"Stop it."""" I laughed", putting my jacket on and grabbing his hand. He wiggled his eyebrows and winked at me before we walked out the office.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have a nice day," Ms. Fortunato."""" Sarah said slyly. I gave her my stink eye", but smiled back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Michael led me to his G-wagon and I hopped in, wondering where he was going to take me. When he slid into the driver's seat, I turned to him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Where are we going?"""" I asked. He smirked"," but said nothing as he drove out the parking lot and onto the highway. """"Mikey"," tell me.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nope."""" He said"," popping the 'p'. """"You'll just have to see for yourself."""" I huffed and sat back", racking my brain. Were we going to a restaurant? A movie? Maybe it wasn't as cliche as those....a park? I stopped trying and just decided to go along with the surprise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ooo this is my song."""" Michael said suddenly"," turning up the radio. """"I came in like a wreckinggggg ballllllllll!"""" He hollered along with the song and I burst out laughing at his horrible singing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stoppppp!!!"""" I yelled over him and he flashed me a grin. """"You sound terrible.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'll have you know that I sound like John Legend when I sing. All the ladies say so."""" Michael said", winking as he turned a corner and drove into a parking lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well," I'll have to hear that for myself."""" I challenged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You will soon."""" Michael promised and hopped out. He jogged over to my side and opened my door for me", helping me out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Such a gentleman."""" I joked and he smiled genuinely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always," for you."""" Butterflies danced in my stomach", making me feel nervous all of sudden. I looked at were we were and my eyes widened when I saw the sign 'Luxury Golf Course'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We're golfing?"""" I asked", bewildered. Now this was new. Golfing as a date choice? Pretty original.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes," ma'am. Follow me."""" He grabbed my hand and weaved his fingers through mine. I looked down and smiled. I would never get tired of this. He led me into the building and I was immediately enveloped in an air conditioned atmosphere. He walked to the desk", where the receptionist was sitting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The lady looked up and immediately straightened when she saw Michael. """"Hello! How may I help you?"""" She said", poking her chest out a little bit. I rolled my eyes. Seriously? Michael didn't seem to notice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I need two slots for me and my girlfriend."""" He stated and my eyes widened. So he was paying attention to the failed attempts the girl was trying to make. The girl's eyes flitted to me and she frowned before turning to her computer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sure."""" She typed away before pointing to the lockers down the hall. """"Grab 8 and 9.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thank you so much."""" Michael flashed him one of his panty dropping smiles and the girl immediately smiled back. I choked back a laugh as we walked to our bags.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You can't shut her down and then charm her."""" I whispered", laughing at the same time. He faced the bags, but turned his head, looking down at me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why not? I do it to you all the time."""" I gasped playfully and hit his arm. He bit his lip and chuckled. """"I'm joking."""" He kissed my cheek and then grabbed both bags filled with golf clubs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can hold my own," you know."""" I reached up to grab a bag from his shoulders", but he swatted my hand away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uh," uh. I got it. Now walk."""" He patted my butt and urged me forward. I shook my head. He was always the perfect gentleman. We walked outside to the course and we started at the beginning. I had a hard time getting the balls in the holes (haha). Michael", though, was a pro. After an hour, I gave up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You're making me look bad," Mikey."""" I whined", throwing my club on the ground. I plopped down on the grass and looked up at him. He looked so good with his long sleeves rolled up to his elbows and his windblown hair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hey, stop whining. C'mon," let me give you a tutorial."""" I groaned but accepted his hand and he pulled me up. I tumbled into his chest and breathed out a laugh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay," show off."""" He smiled and turned me around so that my back was pressed to his front.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You start off like this."""" He placed his hands on my hips", gripping tightly. My breathing increased as I realized this was indeed sexual. He grabbed a club and placed it in my hands. He put his large hands over mine," guiding it. """"Then you bend down ever so slowly..."""" His breath hit the side of my neck and desire coursed through me. I couldn't believe I was getting turned on as he bent over me slightly", my ass hitting his bulge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Michael..."""" I breathed"," womb clenching. """"Fuck it."""" I let go of the club and turned around", grabbing Michael's shirt and pressing my lips against his. He chuckled before kissing me back, cupping the back of my neck. A throat cleared behind Michael and we separated slightly, Michael's arms still around me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Michael."""" A man's voice called out. I froze", recognizing that voice. No way. It couldn't be. I looked around Michael and seeing the man confirmed my thoughts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It was Lance.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64716;""Lance stood there", grinning at the both of us as if he was in on an inside joke. Michael turned around and put a possessive arm around me, pulling me close to his side. Lance looked the same as he did years ago, but rougher. He had a bushy beard and his black hair looked oily. Ew.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Long time," no see Arielle."""" He sneered", showing his teeth. I shivered with disgust, not believing that I actually dated this beast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For a good reason."""" I responded", wanting to get as far away from him as possible. Lance's eye flickered to Michael and a sinister smile crept onto his face.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He tsked three times," shaking his head. """"Michael", Michael, Michael. I'm sure you know why I'm here. Breaking the rules," as always."""" He shoved his hands in his pockets"," looking up at the sky. """"It's such a beautiful day", isn't it," Arielle?"""" He asked me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What do you want," Lance?"""" I asked. He walked closer", but Michael's hand stopped him from reaching me. Lance's eyes widened with glee and he almost squealed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My, my, my Michael very possessive now," are we? I wonder what you-know-who is going to think of this--"""" His eyes went from me to Michael. """"--relationship."""" He sighed deeply as if he had a weight on his shoulders. """"Oh well. Guess you'll face the consequences later. It was nice chatting with you guys. Toddle-loo."""" He waved his fingers and literally skipped off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I released a breath I didn't know I was holding and turned to Michael. He was staring out in space, face hard. He seemed too tense from that quick and weird encounter with Lance. I wondered who Lance was talking about," but I decided it was just a bunch of nonsense to run Michael off.  """"Hey"," what's wrong?"""" ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Him. I just can't--""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Forget about him," okay? He's just crazy and he's always spouting off some nonsense."""" I tried to convince him. Michael nodded and kissed my hand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks," Ari."""" He smiled", but it didn't reach his eyes. I ignored it for now," not wanting to ruin a perfectly good date. """"Let's get something to eat. I'm starving."""" He changed the subject quickly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You're always starving."""" I said", giggling and grabbing my bag before he could. We walked back inside, put the bags where they belonged, and hopped inside his car.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Where do you want to eat at?"""" He asked", eyes on the road. I took that time to stare at him like a creeper. His face was dusted with a beard that was shaped up to look fresh and clean. It accented the dimples on his cheek that seemed to appear no matter what. His blonde hair wasn't long, but it wasn't short either," curling in just the right places. """"Ari?"""" ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I snapped out of my daze and looked at his eyes. A smirk was on his lips. """"What?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You were checking me out," weren't you?"""" He asked", his eyes flitting from me to the road repeatedly. I blushed deeply and looked away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No."""" I lied and he laughed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Liar," liar pants on fire."""" He taunted playfully. He flexed his bicep and my eyes widened at the large muscle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oh my god."""" I mouthed. """"What are you"," twelve?"""" I asked", laughing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maybe."""" He wiggled his eyebrows and I smiled", shaking my head. He never ceased to make me smile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We finally decided to eat at a burger joint because you can never go wrong with a burger. After we ate, we stayed there, talking, laughing, and joking until my phone started to ring.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hello?"""" I answered", putting a stick of gum in my mouth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ari! I need you," pronto! Like now! My place! Bye!"""" Rayna screamed in my ear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Goddammit," Ray."""" I mumbled", rubbing my ear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Who was that?"""" Michael asked", leaning forward on his elbows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rayna. She said she needs me at her place," pronto."""" I repeated her words", sighing. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alright, let's go. Same place," right?"""" He asked", while I slid from my booth. I nodded and we swiftly walked to his car. He took me to Rayna's house plenty of times to know where to take me. When we got there, he opened my side and helped me out, walking me to her front door.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I had a great time today. Thank you."""" I said", wrapping my arms around his torso. He hugged me back, chuckling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I did too. Anytime, angel," anytime. Now go help your friend.....do whatever it is you guys need to do."""" I smiled and stood on my tippy toes to plant a kiss on his lips. He leaned back avoiding my lips. I tried again and he leaned the other way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Michael!"""" He burst out laughing and finally kissed me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You gotta admit that was kinda funny."""" He said", walking backwards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I stuck my tongue out at him. """"No"," it wasn't."""" He was about to respond when he tripped"," almost falling. """"That's what you get. Karma!"""" He flicked me off", jogging to his car and then blew me a kiss.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"See ya tomorrow!"""" He yelled before slipping into his car. I waved and walked into Rayna's house. It was pretty big and I was so happy when she got her own place so that I wouldn't hear her and Marco doing the nasty all the time. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ray! I'm here!"""" I yelled and my voice echoed through the rooms. I walked to the entertainment room and found her and Marco making out. """"Ugh"," seriously! Save that for your honeymoon."""" I said", hopping onto the stool by the bar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rayna giggled and climbed off of Marco," running towards me. """"I missed you"," my bestie. We haven't seen each other in sooooo--""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's been four days," Ray."""" I stated"," hugging her back. Marco got off the couch and nodded at me. """"Hey Ari"," how you doing?"""" I shrugged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Same old," same old. Are you ready for the wedding?"""" I asked", smiling.  Marco pursed his lips and looked at Rayna.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I don't know. I think I'll have to find another person to marry because this one is out of her mind."""" He said", smacking Rayna's butt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hey!"""" She said frowning. Marco grinned and kissed her forehead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm joking," babe. I love you. I'll be in my office. Nice seeing you Ari."""" I waved as he left and Rayna sighed deeply.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He's just so....dreamy. I can't believe we're engaged."""" I scoffed", rolling my eyes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah," me neither. So why do you need me so badly that you cut my date short?"""" I asked", twirling around the stool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Aw I interrupted your date with Mr. FineAss Mikey?"""" She said in a baby voice", pinching my cheeks. I slapped her hands away and winced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shut up. Now what do you need," my most annoying best friend in the entire world?"""" Suddenly", Ray got serious and sat down in the stool next to me. She took a deep breath before speaking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sam visited me.""""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64717;""*prsmkdwn-b**WARNING! THIS CHAPTER CONTAINS MATURE/SEXUAL CONTENT. IF YOU ARE NOT 18 YEARS OLD OR OLDER", READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.* */prsmkdwn-b*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What?! Are you serious?"""" I asked", alarmed. Rayna nodded, and from the look on her face, I knew she was telling the truth. She was rarely ever serious.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah, earlier today. I don't know how he found me," but he did. He didn't hurt me or anything. Just rambled about how those that sinned will pay the price soon."""" She shuddered at the memory. """"It was a bunch of bull. I ran off afterwards.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I thought about that. Why would Sam come and visit Rayna," after all these years. All I could do was hope that he wouldn't hurt her because of something that happened a long time ago. """"So", are you ready for your wedding," tomorrow?"""" Rayna and Marco had been engaged for two years now and tomorrow was the big day. Preparing everything had been a pain in the ass", but everything worked out beautifully.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Truthfully," I'm so nervous! I've never been this serious about a relationship since...."""" She raised her eyes to the ceiling"," trying to think of an answer. """"I've never been this serious in a relationship! Oh my god"," this is really happening."""" She said"," panicking. """"I need a drink.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I laughed and pulled her back before she could drown in her wine. """"You'll be fine"," Ray. And I'll be there supporting you through the whole thing."""" She sighed and gave me a big hug.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank you so much. You know I love you," right?"""" She asked", kissing my cheek sloppily.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ew Ray!"""" I wiped my cheek"," laughing. """"Yes"," I know. I love you too."""" She smiled and then looked at the clock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shouldn't you be picking up Ax now?"""" I looked at my watch and gasped.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oh shit! Thanks for reminding me. I totally lost track of time."""" Then I realized I didn't have my car with me. """"Can you drive me to work so I can get my car?"""" Ray nodded", grabbing her keys.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Already on it. Let's go."""" She drove me to my job and I got in my car", driving quickly to make it on time to pick Axel up. When I got there, school was out and the kids were bustling around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ax!"""" I yelled", waving my arms when I spotted my boy. He was chatting with Natalie rapidly, excited about something. He looked up when he heard his name and waved back. He said something to Natalie and she nodded excitedly, following him to my car.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hi," Mommy."""" Axel greeted me", kissing my cheek.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hi baby. Hi Natalie."""" Natalie smiled widely and gave me a big hug.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hi Ari. Can I come to your house today," please?"""" She asked softly", wringing her hands.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Of course! Let me call your dad and tell him," okay?"""" She nodded and got in the back seat with Axel. I dialed Michael's number and sat down", closing my door.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yo."""" Was Michael's answer when he picked up the phone. I breathed a laugh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hey, I'm taking Natalie to my place," okay?"""" I heard rustling in the background before he responded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hmmm," I'll be over in a jiffy then."""" I could hear the teasing tone in his voice and it brought a smile to my face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alright," see ya."""" I hung up", excited that Michael would be coming over. I drove to my house and when I got inside, I sighed," forgetting that I was packing the house up. Boxes were everywhere and it seemed like it would never get done. """"You guys stay down here and play. I'll be taking a shower. Michael is on his way so don't freak out when he walks in"," okay?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay," Mommy. But what if we get hungry while you're in the shower?"""" He asked. I shook my head. This boy was always hungry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Then you get a snack. But don't eat everything or you won't have anything for tomorrow."""" Knowing Axel", if I didn't say that, he would eat everything in this house.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Okay!"""" Come on Natalie! There's this new show that came on and--"""" His voice got fainter as they ran towards the entertainment room. That should keep them occupied for a while. I hurried upstairs to take my shower before Michael came.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When I was done, I dried myself and wrapped a towel around my body. I wrung the water from my hair and towel dried it before stepping into my room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Michael!"""" I gasped when I saw him laying back on my bed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hey--whoa."""" He sat up quickly"," his gaze scanning my towel-clad body. """"Seems like I came at the right time."""" He said", winking and I blushed as he stalked forward," towering over me. My breath caught when he pulled me against his wide chest. """"I think I like you even better this way."""" His chest rumbled as he chuckled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of course you do."""" I cracked a smile", running my hands down his chest. He pressed his lips against mine gently and my eyes closed immediately at the feeling. The kiss got more heated before I knew it, we were full on making out. He slipped his tongue in my mouth and I moaned, unbuttoning his shirt. He stopped my hands from going any further.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You sure you wanna do this?"""" He asked and I smiled at how much of a gentleman he was.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I one hundred percent sure," Michael. Now take off your shirt."""" I responded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He flung it to the floor and smiled cheekily as he did the same with his pants. His large bulge strained against his boxers and I felt my whole both heat up with desire. When he pulled me back towards him, my towel fell, exposing my naked body.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Holy--"""" He trailed off", gobbling up my body with his eyes as if it was the best thing he'd ever saw. He guided me to the bed and roughly pressed his lips against mine. I put my hands in his hair and brought him closer, not getting enough of his kisses. He ducked his head down and pulled one of my nipples into his mouth, slipping one of his hands between my legs and flicked the swollen nub there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oh my--"""" I moaned loudly and gasped at the wonderful feeling of his hot breath on my heaving chest. Michael removed his hands and took his boxers off", his dick springing free. My mouth fell open at his size, silently wondering if it would fit in me. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Turn around."""" He ordered and I complied", getting on my hands and knees. I screamed out as he unexpectedly thrust into me, driving himself deeply into my body. I moaned in protest as his erection dragged against my walls when he pulled out, but I pushed my hips against his as he moved back into me again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That's it," baby. Take everything."""" He whispered hoarsely into my ear as he leaned over me", covering my back with his chest so that he could palm my breasts. His positioned his hips and thrust into me faster and faster with every breathless cry I gave. A warm tingle spread through my body, and I felt Michael's mouth sucking the skin of my neck and he used his hips to ignite my body with pleasure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh my god," Michael."""" I cried out his name", pushing back to meet his thrusts. He paused and turned me back around on my back so that he was on top. He leaned down to kiss me and my lips softened  against his as he cupped the side of my face with one hand. He pushed into me again and I gasped against his lips, my fingers pulling at his shoulders.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A knock sounded against the bedroom door and we both froze. The door creaked open and Michael covered us with he thick blanket, covering my face and hair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mommy?"""" I heard Axel's voice and cursed under my breath", panting hard. I heard his feet pad over to the bed, where Michael and I were in the middle of mind blowing sex.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Your mom is, uh," in the bathroom taking a shower. She'll be out shortly."""" Michael said", his voice a bit hoarse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay. Tell her me and Natalie are gonna eat her cookies," okay?"""" Michael chuckled deeply.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alright," little man. Close the door on your way out."""" The door closed and I hear footsteps thundering down the stairs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oh my god! I can't believe that just--mmmm."""" Michael shut me up be kissing me hard", obviously wanting to finish what we started. I tightened around him and he groaned against my mouth, moving his hips once again. The pressure in my womb built up and I could feel myself coming close to the edge. Michael grunted as he continually thrusted. He lifted his mouth from mine and looked me straight in the eyes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Desire and undisguised emotion burned deep inside his eyes and something tightened in my chest before I cried out his name, a wave of my orgasm crashing down on me as I spazzed around him. Michael cursed loudly before following right after me, his seed burning my insides. He slumped against me and pulled out, his hot breath ragged, blowing against my neck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Different emotions hit me at one time, and for the first time in my life," I didn't try to pick one.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64718;""""""You hungry?"""" Michael asked"," searching through my fridge. """"Wait"," why am I even asking that. Of course you're hungry."""" I blushed at his words and pulled my robe tighter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A sandwich will be fine. And I can make it myself," you know."""" I said", leaning over to take the bread from him. He moved his hand and held up the bread so high, I couldn't reach it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know you can," but I'm not letting you. Sit down and watch me do my magic.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Michael--""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uh," uh uh. When's the last time you had a man cater to you?"""" He raised his eyebrows knowingly and I sighed", sitting in the chair behind the island.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fine. Work your magic."""" I wiggled my fingers", earning a prize winning smile from Michael.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now," I have to warn you. This will be the best sandwich you have ever tasted in your life."""" He bragged. I rolled my eyes playfully.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's just a sandwich," Mikey."""" I stated", leaning my elbows on the island. He gasped and put a hand to his chest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"How dare you say it's just a sandwich?"""" He asked in a high voice", sauntering over to me. He bare chest and taut abs tightened as he walked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because it is."""" I said", lifting my head to look at him. He looked down at me, raising his eyebrows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'll prove to you that it's not."""" He whispered", leaning down until our lips were a breath away. I stared at his lips before looking into his eyes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Prove it to me."""" I pressed my lips against his softly", leaving them there for a beat before pulling back. The smile he gave me made me melt inside and I wondered why I hadn't gotten with him years ago, when he first started working where I currently worked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daddy!"""" Natalie's voice sounded down the hall and got closer. """"Arielle!"""" We both looked towards the entryway", wondering what the problem was.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We're in the kitchen," Nat!"""" Michael called out. She appeared in the kitchen and put her hands on her knees", panting over dramatically hard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daddy."""" She slinked up to him", putting on her innocent face.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uh, oh. She wants something," Mike."""" I said", laughing. Axel always pulled that trick with me and unfortunately, it always worked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What's on your mind," baby girl?"""" Michael crouched low to be on the same level as Natalie. She clasped her hands together and leaned forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I wanna go to the wedding with Axel."""" She whispered loudly. Michael's eyes widened and he looked up at me", obviously thinking the wrong thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wedding? Uh, sweetie," Ari and I--""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No," Michael she means to say she wants to go to Rayna's wedding. Tomorrow."""" Michael visibly relaxed", swiping his forehead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh, I was scared for a second. I mean not that I don't want to marry you---well not anytime soon," but--"""" Michael rambled on before smacking his hand against his face. """"I'll shut up now."""" I smiled at how uncomfortable he was getting just by talking about marriage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's okay."""" I said softly"," not wanting him to feel any more awkward than he already did. """"You can be my plus one and Natalie can be Axel's....if you want to come of course."""" I said quickly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of course I'll be your date. Hear that Natalie? You're finally going to a wedding."""" Michael told his daughter and she squealed", jumping up and down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thank you thank you thank you!"""" She ran out", hollering Axel's name and Michael and I chuckled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She was going to be a handful when she got older.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
* * *,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It doesn't look right!"""" Rayna said", looking in the mirror. I sighed for the hundredth time that day. It was almost time for Rayna to walk to the alter and marry her long time boyfriend and she was finding every reason to stall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ray, you look beautiful. Come on," it's almost time.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh my god," what if a pimple pops onto my forehead when I'm up there and Marco gets disgusted and changes his mind and leaves me and I never hear from him again?"""" She asked panicking. """"Oh my god"," oh my god...."""" She paced around the large room", where the bridesmaids and me, the maid of honor, were getting ready.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rayna."""" I stopped her with my hands and looked her square in the eye. """"If a guy leaves you because of a blemish on your face", then that guy's an asshole. Marco loves you too much to just leave you on this special day. Trust me," everything will be perfect. Now get out there and be the sexiest bride ever.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rayna smiled and pulled me into a bone crushing hug. """"You are truly the best friend in the entire universe. Now I wanna cry."""" She sniffed. """"But I can't or I'll ruin my makeup."""" She took a deep breath and smoothed her dress out. """"Okay"," let's do this thing.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We formed a line and walked out. I was last because I had to end up right next to the altar. I felt butterflies in my stomach and I wasn't even the one getting married. This reminded me of what it felt like to be engaged to Daxton: preparations, the excitement....but now... I shook my head and put on a smile. This was Rayna's day and I had to be happy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When we got to the front, we took our positions and looked over to where Rayna was walking in. Everyone stood up and whispers of awe went around the room at the beautiful bride. She walked in as if she owned the room and for that day, she actually did. I don't know how I got through the entire ceremony without crying, but I did and I was proud of myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So when they said seeing the bride before the wedding is bad luck," they didn't mean the maid of honor too."""" Michael whispered from behind me and I jumped before turning around.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You scared me!"""" I said laughing", pressing my hand to my chest, trying to still my racing heart. Michael looked good in his tux and blue tie that matched my blue dress. Axel and Natalie were also matching," but with red. They sat with the other kids in the section just for kids. """"And Rayna thought seeing anybody before the wedding was bad luck so..."""" I shrugged my shoulders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mhmm, sure. Now," where can we get some good food?"""" Michael grabbed my hand and led me to the food table. """"Here"," try this."""" Before I could see what he was giving me", he stuffed it in my mouth and some fell to the floor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Michael!"""" I said around a mouthful of what I believed was a turkey cold cut sandwich. He burst out laughing", clutching his belly as he did. I swallowed it and ran my finger against the icing of the cake (I know," not sanitary). """"You asked for it."""" While he was still laughing", I dragged my icing clad finger against his face and even got some in his hair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oh no you didn't."""" He lunged at me"," but I moved out of the way at the last second and he crashed into an empty cart. The hall got silent and Michael held up two thumbs from where he lay on the floor. """"I'm good guys. Go back to....whatever you were doing."""" Some people chuckled and I went to help Michael up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alright," come on you goof--AHH!"""" Michael grabbed my hand and yanked me down to the ground with him", making sure to get the icing from his face onto mine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Karma."""" He said", sliding his arms around my waist. I laughed and I swatted at him when he tried to rub his face on my dress.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stop it," Mikey."""" I smiled at him and and looked up when I saw two pairs of tiny feet by our heads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mommy," stop acting like a kid."""" Axel said", pointing his finger at me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Uhh--"""" I held in a laugh and looked Michael", who was smiling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah daddy, you can't act like us. You're old. Get up," get up."""" Natalie grabbed her father's arm and tried to yank him up"," but was too weak. """"Axel help me!"""" She cried and Axel grabbed Michael's other arm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh," man you guys are strong."""" Michael said", as he allowed the kids to think they were really picking him up. When he was standing fully, he picked me up bridal style and twirled me around. I squealed and wrapped my arms around his neck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You're gonna make me dizzy."""" I breathed", closing my eyes and putting my head underneath his chin. He put me down, arms still around me. I opened my eyes again to see Michael staring down at me adoringly. An unrecognizable emotion clawed at my heart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What?"""" I asked softly. Michael didn't answer me. He only wiped the icing from my face and leaned down"," placing a feathery kiss on my forehead and swayed to the slow music that began to play in the background.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64719;""""""Ax"," come and help me with these boxes!"""" I yelled from upstairs in Axel's room. We were finally moving out of Daxton's house and into the penthouse in the hotel that my family owned. When Axel was of age", everything was going to go to him. I put my hand on my hip, waiting for his pattering footsteps and when I didn't hear anything," I started to get worried. """"Axel?"""" I called out. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I walked down the hall, looking into the rooms before walking downstairs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And then I was like pow!"""" I heard his voice faintly. """"But"," you can't be here. Mommy will get mad."""" I heard a deep voice answer Axel"," but I couldn't hear it clearly enough to know who it was. """"Yeah huh", Daddy! She will be really," really mad and--""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Daxton," what are you doing here?"""" I asked", walking towards the two of them slowly. Axel looked nervous, as if he did something wrong. Daxton was dressed down, wearing a black shirt, black jeans, and black shoes. My heart sputtered a little bit, but I shoved away the feeling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I came to see my son. And get my house back."""" I scoffed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We haven't seen you in weeks and you expect me to believe that?"""" I said angrily. Daxton shrugged and smirked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't care what you believe," Arielle."""" He drawled my name out and walked towards me. I backed up a bit and he stopped", cocking his head.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Interesting..."""" He trailed off", his gaze sweeping over my body.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well, you're in luck because we're moving out, today. You'll have your house by the end of the day. But for now," you need to leave."""" I ignored the lustful way he looked at me and motioned to Axel to come by me. Daxton's hand shot out and gripped Axel's arm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ow," daddy that hurts!"""" Axel cried out and my chest tightened.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Daxton," let him go."""" I said cautiously", walking towards them to get Axel from his clutches. Daxton eyed me like an animal as I came closer, with my hands stretched out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why should I? I think I wanna spend some time with my son and you're not letting me.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop lying!"""" I cried out. """"Just leave us alone", Daxton," please."""" He grabbed my arm and yanked me towards him", crushing me to his chest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You think I'm lying?"""" He growled in my ear menacingly. """"I made him with you"," if my memory serves me well and I get to spend as much time as I want with him."""" ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not if you leave for four years!"""" I shouted", struggling against him. But his grip was like a vice and I whimpered when he squeezed tighter, getting angry. He let go of Axel's hand and gipped my other arm with his other hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hmmm, I think we should make another baby," right now. What do you think?"""" He asked", sniffing my hair. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'd rather die."""" I spit out. Daxton grinned manically and cupped the back of my neck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You don't know how accurate you will be...soon."""" With that", he crushed his lips hard against mine and I shook my head, trying to free myself. The kiss was punishable and there was nothing nice about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daddy! Let Mommy go!"""" Axel cried out", and I heard him kick Daxton's leg with his little feet. Daxton shoved him and and Axel fell to the ground. I pounded my fists on Daxton's chest and bit his lip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fuck!"""" He yelped in pain and I breathed heavily", lips swollen and bruised. I ran to Axel's side, kneeling down and drawing him close.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He hurt my arm."""" Axel said", whimpering. Tears slid down his face and I wiped them away. Daxton pressed his thumb to his lip and came away with blood. Fire ignited in his eyes and he turned his burning gaze to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You're gonna regret that."""" He said darkly", and charged at me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I wouldn't do that if I were you."""" Daxton skidded to a stop and turned around to see who said that. I sighed with relief when I saw that it was Michael. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daxton laughed and walked over to Michael. """"And what are you gonna do about it"," Mikey?  You seem awfully attached to her now. I wonder why."""" Daxton looked over his shoulder at me. """"Have you two been fucking?"""" He asked and I immediately blushed"," not wanting to answer his question. """"Ahh"," you sly dog. You're in big trouble now."""" He taunted. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Michael frowned and clenched his fists by his sides. """"You need to leave. Now."""" Daxton coked his head to the side and ran his hand through his shoulder length hair.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fine. See ya soon," Ari."""" Daxton winked at me and I cringed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Not likely."""" I muttered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That's debatable."""" He smiled and walked out the door. """"I want my house back!"""" He sang loudly from outside and I felt tears drip down my face. Why did I have to have a kid with such an asshole? ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Are you okay?"""" Michael asked", rushing to my side, scanning me up and down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm fine."""" I winced when I stood up and Michael noticed. """"You came just in time.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No you're not. He hurt you. Yeah, I was, uh," in the area and I saw Daxton's car in the driveway."""" I brushed Michael's touch away", not wanting to feel anyone touch me at the moment. How did he know what Daxton's car looked like? And was it luck that he came at the right moment?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I said I'm fine."""" I snapped before turning to Axel"," who had stopped crying. """"You okay"," baby?"""" I whispered", brushing his hair out of his face. He nodded and hugged me tight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daddy's a meanie. I don't wanna see him again!"""" He said", his voice muffled because he pressed his face against my shirt. I rubbed his back and looked up at Michael, whose face was neutral. I sighed and grabbed his hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm sorry. I just--""""  I blinked back tears", trying not to break down. Michael cupped my cheek.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I understand, Ari. I really do. Now, let's get these boxes out of here," yeah?"""" I nodded and intertwined my fingers with the ones that were on my cheek.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank you," Michael."""" He smiled and kissed my other cheek.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Anytime."""" He bent low to face Axel. """"Wanna see who can pack the boxes the fastest?"""" He asked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah! I'm gonna beat you!"""" Axel challenged", running up the stairs to his room to grab his boxes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Go get em tiger."""" I laughed and Michael winked at me before following Axel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
* * *,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally."""" I said", plopping down onto my sofa in my new penthouse. It was large and spacious and Daxton free. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My room is bigger!"""" Axel said happily"," jumping onto the sofa next to me. I smiled and started tickling him. """"Mommy! Stop it!"""" He squealed", giggling like a maniac. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alright, alright. Hey," I have a question for you."""" Axel looked up at me with his bright silver eyes", attentive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Okay."""" He said", getting comfortable against my side.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Do you think that....that we'll be better off without Daddy?"""" I asked", looking down at him. He seemed to think about it for a second and then nodded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah we will because he's mean to me and to you and you're perfect so I don't know why he does that."""" He stated and I laughed. """"Plus"," we have Michael.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm not perfect," baby."""" Axel nodded his head vigorously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uh huh," even Michael said so."""" Axel argued. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He did?"""" I asked", feeling warm inside from his statement. Michael thought I was perfect?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wanna know what I want for my birthday tomorrow?"""" He asked", eyes glinting with excitement. Axel's birthday was tomorrow and he was turning five. Time flew by so quickly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What?"""" I said", knowing exactly what he wanted. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A Flash suit! I could wear it for costume day at school and maybe even Halloween!"""" I chuckled and ruffled his hair.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sure, whatever you want. Time for bed," quirt."""" Axel hopped off the couch and grabbed my hand", leading me to his room. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love you," Mommy."""" Axel whispered as I tucked him in. I smoothed his hair back and kissed his forehead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love you too," Ax. Sweet dreams."""" I turned off his light and went to the living room to wait for Michael to come over. He should be coming any minute now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
* * *,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A bang came from the front door and I shot up groggily. I must have fallen asleep waiting for Michael. I looked at the clock and it read 4:30 a.m. I got up slowly and grabbed the bat. A shadowy figure came near me and I swung.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ow! Ari," it's me!"""" Michael groaned", rubbing his head. I breathed a sigh of relief and threw the bat to the side.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What are you doing here?"""" I whispered"," not wanting to wake Axel up. Michael turned on the light in the hallway and I saw that the bottom half of him was covered in dirt. """"And what the hell were you doing?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I--uh," I came to see you. And I was working."""" Michael stammered and I frowned. Working this late? Highly unlikely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You were supposed to meet me hours ago! Where were you?"""" I asked", crossing my arms over my chest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know," I'm sorry. I had business to take care of."""" He said", repeating the same words he had been telling me for the past weeks now whenever he left abruptly. It was finally getting old. I narrowed my eyes at him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You need to leave."""" I said plainly and his jaw dropped.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What? Why? You wanted me here," so I'm here.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I wanted you here seven hours ago," Michael."""" I argued.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm here now. What more do you want?"""" He asked", obviously getting frustrated. I shook my head and laughed humorlessly. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just leave please."""" I opened the door and gestured for him to leave. I wasn't in the mood and I was tired. Michael gave me a withering look and sighed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Whatever you want," Ari."""" He said softly before leaving. I closed the door behind him and leaned against it. Something was up with him and I was determined to figure it out.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"64721;""After dropping Axel off to my parents' house the next day", I decided to follow Michael around to see what he actually does during the day, when he says he's 'working'. No one worked on the weekends unless they were obsessed or not self employed. And he was definitely not obsessed with work. I hopped in my black jeep, a vehicle I almost never used and one Michael wouldn't recognize, and drove to the corner of his street.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now, it was time to watch. Since he was just leaving his house, there was nothing interesting there. He swung his little girl around and gave her a huge kiss before leaving her with the nanny. He got into his car and drove down the road. I followed closely, but not too closely, behind him. After about an hour of riding around and watching him do seamless things, I started to think I was wrong about Michael. Maybe he was actually telling me the truth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just when I began to think that, I followed him to the side of the bank, where almost no one was at. I parked behind him, since he wouldn't recognize my vehicle, put on my sunglasses, and watched him. He was on his phone, arguing with somebody.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Come on," don't make me regret doing this."""" I muttered to myself. Michael leaned against the brick wall as if he was waiting for someone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I perked up and watched a man in black walk over to Michael. They shook hands and Michael looked around before handing him something. I squinted trying to see what it was, but failed. The man looked behind him, past my jeep and I gasped. It was Jeremy. But he was supposed to be in prison. I got more and more confused as I tried to wrap my head around all of this. How did they know each other?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Look," just take this. You sure I'll be good after this?"""" I overheard Michael asking Jeremy. Jeremy nodded", slipping the unknown thing into his pocket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah," you'll be alright. I'll get the guys off your back."""" Michael seemed relieved and I wondered what kind of business he was doing with Jeremy. Was this the 'work' he was doing everyday when he left from being with me. I frowned and decided that I'd seen enough. I drove back hope", so many questions filling my brain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Could I still trust Michael, while knowing that he was doing business with the guy that had something to do with my kidnapping five years ago? I pushed all of that aside and decided to focus on Axel's party for the moment and deal with Michael later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wow! I wish I had a party like this when I was younger."""" Rayna said in awe", looking at all of the decorations, clowns, and more that littered the party.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I smiled and nodded, though I had parties like these when I was younger. It seemed as if the entire school was at Axel's party. He ran around in his Flash suit that I had custom made and Natalie ran with him in her Wonder Woman costume. They were literally too cute.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But imagine how much cleaning will have to be done after this."""" I commented", watching my son.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yuck," never mind. I'm glad I didn't because I didn't have the luxury of hiring a maid to do all my cleaning like you do."""" Rayna pointed out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I tilted my head back and laughed. """"That's so true. Well"," you do now.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Soooo," where's Michael?"""" I immediately frowned when I heard his name. The nanny had dropped off Natalie and he didn't even have the decency to come to the party with her. """"Trouble in paradise? Spill!"""" I sighed and shook my head.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's dumb and I can't even explain it myself since I don't know all the details. All I know is that he's been dealing with Jeremy for what seems to be a while now."""" Rayna's eyes widened and she slapped my arm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shut up! No way! How do you know?"""" I pulled my bottom lip into my mouth nervously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uh," I kinda followed him around today. Without him knowing."""" I confessed and she gasped loudly. I shushed her and she dragged me to a corner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You did what?! Omg," Ari you crazy slut! You found out from following him?"""" She whispered fiercely and I nodded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He was always disappearing on me at odd times and it's been going on for weeks now. He came to my house at 4:30am!"""" I hissed and Rayna scoffed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You should've been pleased! I wish a guy would come in the middle of the night slash early morning for me."""" She said", crossing her arms over her chest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He was supposed to come at 9:30pm."""" I said flatly and her mouth made an 'o' shape.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unacceptable."""" she stated firmly. Suddenly", all of the kids started cheering and screaming. I looked up, alarmed. What was going on? All of them seemed to swarm to one spot in the center of the room, so I walked over to see what the big fuss was about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I can't believe it! Mommy," look!"""" Axel cried out", pointing down. I looked and saw that there was a kid sized, drivable jeep with the Flash painted all over it. I looked back up and saw Michael next to him, holding a toy key. When did he get here?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every boy needs their own ride. Here you go," little man."""" Michael handed Axel the keys to his jeep and Axel hugged his leg.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank you," Michael! You're the best dad ever!"""" Axel said and the words hit my heart. He thought of Michael as a father? Michael smiled but then looked at me quickly. My hand flew to my mouth and I shook my head backing away. I ran out the room and into the hallway", dry sobs trying to make their way up my chest. I didn't know whether to be happy about how Axel felt, or sad that it might not last long because of what I saw today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ari?"""" Michael looked around before spotting me and then jogged over. """"Ari"," look I'm sorry--""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For what? Earlier or for doing business with Jeremy?"""" I said"," getting straight to the point. There was no point in hiding it any longer. Michael's mouth dropped open. """"Yeah", thought I wouldn't find out," huh? What were you doing with him? You know my history with him.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Michael ran a hand down his face," caught up. He obviously didn't intend for me to find out...ever. """"I know how this looks"," but I can explain."""" I crossed my arms over my chest", waiting. Just then," all of the lights went off.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64722;""""""Everybody down!"""" An unrecognizable voice yelled and everyone started screaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh my god," what's going on?"""" I asked Michael", panicking. When I didn't hear a response I turned towards him," though I couldn't see him. """"Michael?"""" Silence. Fear beat against my heart and flowed through my veins"," and my first thought was to get to Axel. """"Axel!"""" I called out", hoping I could find him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't move a muscle. If you want your kid to live," listen to my instructions."""" Another voice said from behind me", pressing something hard against my back. I froze and automatically assumed it was a gun and my adrenaline kicked in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What do you want?"""" I asked", not moving. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Go out the front door and meet me downstairs. Don't try to get away because I will hunt you down."""" The man threatened and I nodded"," even though he couldn't see me. """"Got it?"""" He pressed the barrel of the gun harder against my back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes," yes I understand."""" I said quickly and the presence of the gun disappeared.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Go."""" I wasted no time finding my way to my front door and taking off. All I could hope was that Michael would be able to get to Axel in time and fight off those men. I decided to take my chances and try to escape. I ran downstairs to the lobby and look around", not seeing anyone suspicious. I ran out the building and ran down the street to get to my car.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I was panting hard and my chest burned, but I was determined to reach it and call for help. I couldn't let those psychos hurt those kids under my watch. Before I could take another step, a black van screeched to a halt and two men wearing masks jumped out, dashing towards me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No."""" I breathed and turned around", running the other way. I was tackled from behind and we all fell to the ground in a big heap/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I told ya not to run!"""" The man front upstairs' voice grated in my ear as he yanked me up roughly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Let me go!"""" I yelled. """"Help! Hel--"""" The man covered my mouth with his hand and tossed me into the van as if I weighed nothing. Two more men were in the van", wearing the same masks. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tie her up."""" The man ordered before sliding the door shut. I wasn't going down without a fight. I ducked under one of the men's arms and head butted his chest", making him lose his balance. Then I swung and punched the next guy in the face, getting a pained cry out of him before the other one grabbed me and shoved me down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I was breathing hard and my face was smushed against the carpet of the van. """"What do you want with me?!"""" I screamed", thrashing against his hold. Chuckles sounded throughout the van and I shivered, started to get scared. This was really happening again. I was getting kidnapped.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh," you'll find out soon enough."""" One snickered. I huffed and kicked my leg back", nailing him in the face.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You stupid bitch!"""" He shouted", holding his now bloody nose. I smiled with satisfaction but froze when the guys, who I was guessing was the leader spoke.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Knock her out."""" A fist collided with my skull and I saw black.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
* * *,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I moaned as hot pain pulsed against my skull. I opened my eyes, but all I could see was black. I blinked multiple times, but still saw black. Did I lose my eyesight? I moved my head and realized a bag was over it, which was why I was only seeing black. I heard people bustling around and I tried to move my arms, but they were ties up tight and stretched up, making me hang a few inches off the floor, my toes still slightly touching.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think she's up!"""" A familiar voice sounded and the bag was ripped off my head. My eyes burned as light filled them in an instant and when my vision adjusted", I couldn't believe my eyes. Lance stood in front of me," his manic smile plastered on his face. """"And the princess awakes."""" He said with glee", clapping his hands together.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I looked around the large room and saw that I was in the same place I was last time I was kidnapped, Except, it was cleaner, had more white power, which now I'm guessing was cocaine, and a lot more firearms. Lance backed up away from me and I took a good look at the people. Most of them were unfamiliar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sam and Jeremy. Why am I not surprised."""" I said bitterly", licking my dry lips. My throat was parched, but I didn't dare say anything about it or else they would use it against me. Sam smiled and waved as if we were seeing each other at a fair. Jeremy just kept his arms crossed," disinterested. """"So"," you were the guys behind my kidnapping? Why?"""" I asked", trying to get something out of them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They looked at each other and laughed," as if in on an inside joke. """"She really doesn't know", does she? Gosh," after all these years.?"""" Lance said", chuckling and shaking his head.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What are you talking about? Where's Axel and Michael?"""" I asked", yanking at my binds. I swept my eyes for anything that would be able to help me, but found nothing. My arms started to ache and I wondered what they really wanted me for. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh, speaking of Michael, I hear you guys are getting pretty serious," hmm?"""" Lance walked to me and gripped my chin in his hand. """"Michael has a lot of secrets"," my dear. Wanna know some of them?"""" He whispered", blowing his awful breath in my face.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I want to know why you ordered them to kidnap me."""" I spit", wanting to bite his fingers off. He laughed and let my chin go. He walked over to where Sam and Jeremy were and stood there like a soldier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh," I wasn't the one who ordered them to kidnap you. He was."""" Lance pointed behind me", but I couldn't turn my head.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Who is he?!"""" I yelled", tired of Lance's games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It was me."""" Daxton stepped out from behind me"," smiling.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64723;""My mouth fell open when I saw Daxton's face. He walked around me", seeming very comfortable in this situation. The first emotion I felt was hurt.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daxton? How could you do this to me?"""" I asked", still in shock. He breathed a laugh and stepped close to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because, princess," I needed to."""" He said bluntly", cocking his head.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why?"""" I pressed"," wanting to know why he would do something like this. """"Wait"," were you part of the plan to kidnap me the first time?"""" Daxton nodded and walked over to stand in front of his henchmen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You were actually supposed to die, but I decided at the last minute to 'save' you so that it would be more enjoyable this time. I mean, no one wants to kill a pregnant lady," am I right?"""" He asked everyone in the room and they all agreed", smiling like crazy people. Which they were. My heart squeezed and I could feel tears building up on my tear ducts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What's wrong with you? You're crazy! I hate you!"""" I screamed", yanking my arms to try and weaken my binds. I thrashed and screamed like a madwoman, wanting to rip Daxton's head off for putting me through this. Daxton frowned, walked towards me, and smacked my cheek hard. My head whipped to the side painfully and my cheek started to throb with pain. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shut the hell up."""" He clasped his hands together in front of him and paced. """"Now"," it's time for the good stuff."""" He turned to face me again. """"Wanna know who you're really dating"," princess? Bring him out!"""" Daxton shouted. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I looked up and gasped when I saw who they were bringing out. It was Michael and his hands were tied in front of him. His cheek was bruised," but that seemed to be the only thing wrong with him. """"Michael!"""" He looked at me", a worried look on his face. I couldn't believe they kidnapped him too. He was supposed to be my way out and now we were both captured.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ahh," Mr. Michael. Glad you could join us. Please have a seat."""" Daxton shoved Michael into a chair that sat in front of a wooden table and grabbed Michael's tied hands", placing them flat on the table. Daxton sat on the table and I started to freak out when he pulled out a knife to stuck it in the table in front of Michael's hands.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Did you really think kidnapping the both of us was going to solve something?"""" I yelled angrily. Daxton guffawed and his henchmen started laughing loudly. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Kidnapped? I didn't kidnap Michael. He works for me."""" I frowned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What?"""" I was confused. """"Yeah"," he works for you. At the office. What does that have to do with this?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh my god, you're really a dumb blonde," aren't you? To think I was going to marry you."""" Now that one stung. """"No"," Michael was in on the plan to kidnap you. Kill you. Dispose of you. All of the above."""" His words were like a slap to the face and I lost all my breath.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No, you're lying! Michael," he's lying right?"""" I asked", praying it wasn't true. A pained look took over Michael's face and he looked down, obviously ashamed. The tears I had so desperately wanted to keep down started to fall like bullets down my face. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I felt as if someone ripped my heart out of my chest and put it back in, just to rip it out again. Jeremy walked over and cut my binds, making me fall to the floor. I didn't bother running or trying to escape because it was hopeless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ari," I'm sorry. You weren't supposed to find out like this. I didn't know what their plan was for you! Please believe me."""" Michael pleaded. I looked up at him", disgusted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You want me to believe that you weren't in on this whole thing?! They want to kill me and you were helping them!"""" I yelled", getting up. He closed his eyes and opened them again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tell her why you were there just in time to save our son."""" Daxton told Michael"," grinning. """"Ooo"," this is getting good!"""" I swallowed and waited for Michael to speak.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I, uh," I was there to meet you."""" He finally said. Daxton frowned and took the knife out of the table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tell her the whole thing.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That is the whole thing."""" Michael said", looking at Daxton. The knife came down on the table, close to Michael's fingers and a yelp passed through my lips. My heart accelerated at Daxton's violent side. I never knew he could be this way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tell her the whole thing," or you lose a finger for every lie you tell and every detail you skip.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay," okay. I was supposed to save your son and get close to you till the point that you would be able to.....to trust me. And I was gonna take you here."""" My throat closed up and I pressed my hand to my mouth"," shaking my head. This was all a game to him. """"But I couldn't"," Ari. I started to fall for you and I met with Jeremy multiple times because I wanted out. I didn't want to see you get hurt and I didn't know what they wanted with you.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No," don't try and put your feelings in this. They're all lies. All of you are liars!"""" I yelled", backing up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ari," please! I....I love you."""" He confessed", eyes watering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No!"""" I cried out. """"You can't do this to me! Don't--"""" I couldn't finish because I broke down crying", not knowing what or who to believe. I felt as if my life was one huge bubble of mistakes and I would never get to be happy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aw, boo hoo. So sad. You guys make me wanna puke. Now," for the real reason why you're here. I want the code."""" Daxton said", facing me. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I--I don't know it."""" I lied", wiping my face. The code was a combination that had all of my father's assets and wealth in. Daxton grabbed my shirt and yanked me towards him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you don't want to see your precious Michael die by my hand," you will tell me right now!"""" He shouted in my face. My eyes flickered behind him and I saw Michael give me one more pitying look before he shot out of his seat and dashed towards us. He swung his arms and brought them down on Daxton's head. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ari," run!"""" Michael shouted to me as Daxton fell to the ground", moaning in pain. I took off, running around the room where Daxton's guards weren't stationed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Get her!"""" Some yelled as they ran after me. I ran out the door and the sunlight pierced my eyeballs. I ignored the uncomfortable pain and looked around", realizing that we were on a pier. I heard Michael's pained cry and I turned around in time to see Daxton overpower Michael and shoot a bullet into his chest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Michael!"""" I screamed as Michael fell to the floor"," blood flowing out of him. """"No!"""" """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64724;""I was about to run back to help him", but someone grabbed me from behind. I gasped and saw that it was Jeremy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Let me go!"""" I yelled", kicking his shin. He cursed, but didn't let me go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shut up and follow me. I'll get you out of here. These guys are crazy."""" He said", leading me to the other side of the pier. As I followed him, I frowned. Why was he helping me? Was he just going to bring me back to the others?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why are you helping me?"""" I voiced my thoughts. He rolled his eyes and looked around the corner before beckoning me to follow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I was never in on this bullshit. I just needed money to leave the country. And you just so happened to be kidnapped the same time I went to Daxton."""" He explained. Just then", a door slammed open and Lance walked out, smiling and pointing his gun.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Going somewhere?"""" He asked", stalking towards us. Jeremy held up his hands and backed up, shielding me from Lance's weapon. I backed up too," not wanting to get shot. """"Give me the girl.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dude," come on. You really think Dax is gonna give you a cut when he gets the code? He's just gonna kill all of you and keep it all for himself."""" Jeremy said and Lance laughed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You're wrong. Now move."""" He moved the gun to the side", gesturing for Jeremy to do the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm not even a part of this. Just let me go and you can have the girl."""" My mouth fell open at his words. So much for helping me escape. Lance thought about it and shrugged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sure. Why not?"""" He fired his gun", shooting Jeremy in the head. Blood spattered on me and I screamed as Jeremy's lifeless body fell into the water.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh my god," why did you do that?!"""" I shrieked. Lance smirked", twirling his gun.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jeremy had nothing to do with any of this. He was only gonna get in the way."""" I backed up slowly", trying not to end up like Jeremy. I quickly turned and ran around the corner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hey!"""" Lance shouted", running after me. I looked back to see how close he was and when I turned back to the front, I crashed into a hard chest. I looked up to see Daxton, with a large knot on his head. He grabbed my arms tightly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perfect. Now, if you won't tell me the code, I have something that will convince you. Lance," the yacht."""" Lance brought down the stairs of one of the yachts and Dax led me onto one named The King. I stumbled when he pushed me and I started to panic", wondering what he was going to do to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dax," I swear I don't know that code! Why don't you ask my dad?"""" I tried to convince him", but he ignored me. He walked over to a door and yanked it up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Get up here."""" Daxton said and I hear feet walking up from the bottom of the yacht. My heart almost dropped when I saw my son.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Axel!"""" I rushed over to him"," but Daxton stood in front of him. """"What are you doing"," Daxton?"""" I asked. Axel peeked from behind his father", obviously scared. He seemed to be fine, though his hair was matted and unruly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'll ask you one more time. What is the code?"""" I contemplated whether or not I should tell him. If I did", my father's empire that he started from scratch to build would be gone. If I didn't, who knew what would happen? I decided to go with the latter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I don't know!"""" I said for the last time. Daxton laughed and shook his head", grabbing Axel's arm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Guess we'll just have to do things the hard way."""" I was confused as to what he meant. He walked over to the edge of the boat and lifted Axel upside down", hanging him over the side of the boat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mommy!"""" Axel screamed", wiggling to get back on the boat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daxton! Stop it! What's wrong with you?!"""" I screamed rushing to the side the boat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stop moving around or I'll drop you."""" Daxton yelled at Axel and Axel stopped"," eyes wide with fear. """"And you", come any closer and I'll drop him. Right below the water is a cage. In that cage are some sharks that haven't been fed in, oh," let's say two weeks. So I'd advise you to spill now or else he's lunch."""" I gasped", heart beating out of my chest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He's your son!"""" I screeched", not moving, scared that he would actually do something to harm Axel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daxton shrugged and moved his arm from side to side. """"I'd suggest you hurry it up because my arm is getting a little tired.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mommy," don't do it!"""" Axel cried out. He was being so brave and tears kept streaming down my face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Daxton, I don't know it. Please," don't do this!"""" I pleaded. Daxton let Axel go", but caught him at the last minute and I screamed, clutching my chest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oops," almsot slipped there. One more lie and he's a goner."""" He threatened. I swallowed and blinked multiple times", deciding to tell him for the sake of Axel's safety.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's--""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daxton King! Put the boy down!"""" A man yelled and I turned around to see that the pier was flooded with cops. One had Lance in handcuffs and was leading him to a squad car. I closed my eyes", not believing they were really here. How did they get here?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Daxton looked up to the sky and laughed heartily. """"Oh man"," I was so close. SO close!"""" He shouted to the sky and moved Axel back onto the boat. Gun were trained on him and he set Axel down before holding his hands up. """"You got me.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Axel ran over to me and I brought him close," pressing my face to his shirt. I sobbed with relief and Axel patted my back. """"Mommy", it's okay. I'm not hurt," see?"""" He stretched out his arms", showing me that he was okay. I smiled and kissed him repeatedly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know, baby," I know."""" I said", cupping his face.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll be back," Ari. Mark my words."""" Daxton threatened as the cops led him away. """"I'll be back!"""" He laugh would forever be imprinted in my brain and I closed my eyes", not wanting to think about anything else but the fact that Axel was safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mommy," you have blood on your face."""" Axel used his shirt to wipe away the blood", staining his white shirt. One of the officers came over and knelt beside us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hey, young man. You were the one who called us," correct?"""" Axel nodded", clinging to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My name is Officer Downey. You must be Axel and this must be your mother," Arielle."""" They shook hands and I nodded at him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You called the cops," baby? How?"""" I asked Axel", bewildered.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Daddy had a phone down there and I knew you were in trouble," so I called the number you said call when there is trouble. 9-1-1."""" He said proudly and I laughed", hugging him tightly. The office also smiled and looked at me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You have one smart boy. He called us saying that his father took you and he heard gunshots and that he was on a boat. When he described the pier," we knew exactly where you guys were. I'm just glad we got here in time."""" The officer explained and I nodded"," feeling the same way. """"Come on. We have to take you guys in to give your statements.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I stood up and grabbed Axel's hand, afraid to let go. We followed the officer down the stairs and when we walked past one of the doors, I looked in to see paramedics surrounding someone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Michael!"""" I let go of Axel's hand and ran inside", pushing past everyone. When I got to him, I fell to my knees beside him," mouth open. They were pumping his chest and I could see the wound where the bullet went through. His face was ashen and it didn't look like he was breathing. """"Oh my god"," is he dead?"""" I asked and they looked at me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ma'am," we need you to move."""" One of the paramedics said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I wanna know! Is he dead?!"""" I yelled", wanting to touch him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No," but he's lost a lot of blood. I don't know if we can save him."""" I gasped.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No! You have to save him! He can't die! You can't let him die!"""" I screamed", lunging forward. Someone grabbed me and I struggled against the person, wanting to stay by Michael's side.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm sorry, miss," but we have to go. Let them take care of him."""" I let Officer Downey lead me away and I strained my neck to look at Michael one last time before I got into the squad car.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64725;""After spending two hours at the police station giving our statements", I had the officer drive us to my house so that I could get my car and I drove straight to the hospital to see how Michael was doing. The voice in my head told me to stop worrying about him, especially since he had something to do with my kidnapping, but I couldn't. I felt drawn to him in ways that I'd never felt before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And you are?"""" the lady behind the counter asked me and I thought about lying and saying that I was his sister", but then I chickened out of it. I didn't have time to argue with another person.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm his girlfriend."""" She nodded and told me the number of his room. I grabbed Axel's hand and hurried to Michael's room before the lady changed her mind. When I got there", my chest started to tighten at how weak Michael looked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I walked over to his bed and sat down in the chair next to it. His faced was purple with bruises and he had a tube in his mouth. Seeing him like this sent my emotions in overdrive and before I knew it, I was crying. I let it all out and Axel put his hand on my shoulder, not saying anything. I cried for ever meeting Daxton, for loving him, pining after him, and trusting him. I cried over the betrayal I felt because of what Daxton and Michael did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I cried even harder when I realized I couldn't trust Michael. Our whole relationship had been based around my kidnapping and I couldn't bear to get betrayed again. My heart just couldn't take it anymore. I thought about how Michael told me that he loved me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love. Was that how I felt about him too, though we'd only been together for almost two months? But we were together every single day, laughing, talking, kissing, hugging, just relaxing together. That's enough time to love someone, wasn't it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Last time I sat in the hospital was because Daxton had gotten into a horrible accident. Seems ironic that he's the reason why I'm back in here."""" I said out loud", gripping Michael's hand. I paused," listening to his heart monitor before continuing. """"He's a wealthy man", and was still so greedy," that he would kill for money."""" I laughed"," shaking my head. """"Look where that's got him.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mommy. Is Michael.....gonna die?"""" Axel whispered", eyes watering. My heart broke and I brought him close.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't know," Ax. I truly don't know.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I don't want him to die!"""" Axel cried", tears streaming down his face. I gulped back my tears and Axel gripped me tightly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I don't either."""" My voice broke and I breathed a shuddering breath. Axel leaned back up and wiped his eyes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm glad Daddy's going to jail."""" He said finally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Me too."""" I kissed his forehead and turned back to face Michael"," still holding his hand. """"And then there's you. You said you loved me"," but---"""" I paused"," blinking multiple times. """"--you hurt me", Michael. Not physically," although it feels like that."""" I looked up to the ceiling and thought about what else to say. """"Although you did what you did", I can't seem to change my feelings for you. I--I love you," Michael. I really do. But I can't do this. I'm sorry. I just can't."""" I leaned over and left a lingering kiss on his lips and some of my tears hit his cheek. I wiped them slowly", memorizing his face before turning away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
* * *,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Michael tried to contact me for two months, but I ignored his calls, texts, voicemails, and even changed the locks on my doors. I wanted nothing to do with him. My life seemed to fall back into it's normal pace and even Axel stopped asking for Michael. By the third month, he stopped. But I still thought about him on a daily basis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mommy," do you think Natalie misses playing with me?"""" Axel asked out of the blue one day", while coloring in the kitchen. I almost dropped the frying pan. He hadn't asked about her since we left the hospital months ago, so I was surprised by his question.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah," I'm sure she does. Why did you ask?"""" I went back to cooking dinner and he shrugged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I miss her. And she gave me note today to give to you."""" He continued coloring", but I looked at him, surprised.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A note? Where is it?"""" I asked. He pursed his lips before smiling and running out the room. He came back with piece of paper flying in his hand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Found it! Here you go."""" He handed me the note and went back to the island to color in his coloring book. """"I wanna go to her house. She's having a birthday party tomorrow."""" I ignored him for two seconds while I read the note. It was from Michael.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dear Arielle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I know you want nothing to do with me and this isn't a note to try and get you back. Natalie is having a birthday party and would love it if Axel could come. If he can, that would be great and would make Natalie very happy. She misses him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Michael,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I crumpled up the note and threw it in the trash. It's just a party. I told myself. You could drop Axel off and leave right after. """"Alright"," I'll take you.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes!"""" Axel did a happy dance and I chuckled"," shaking my head.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64726;""The next day was Saturday and it started to rain like crazy. I drove to Michael's house", hoping to get there and back in time to watch the new episode of the Flash. Yes, I was obsessed too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Come on!"""" I honked my horn at the person in front of me who was driving like a snail. When I got the chance", I switched lanes and got in front of the person, making it to Michael's house in a record of time. Many cars filled his massive driveway and and I reached back to get my umbrella, coming up empty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mommy," let's go! It's starting!"""" Axel rushed me", bouncing up and down in his seat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I can't find my umbrella."""" I explained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I can run! I promise I won't fall."""" He said", opening his door.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Okay," wait up!"""" I put my jacket over my head and walked into the freezing rain and walked quickly after Axel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bye," Mommy!"""" He yelled", running inside.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Have fun!"""" I yelled back", waving. I was soaked to the bone and I just wanted to get back into my warm car.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ari?"""" I froze", not wanting to turn around. I could hear his footsteps walk round until he came into my line of vision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Michael."""" I breathed out", my heart doing jumping jacks. He looked so scrumptious in his tight blazer and jacket. He looked surprised to see me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You're getting soaked. Why don't you come in and--""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Michael I--""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just for a little bit?"""" He asked and I couldn't resist. I went under his umbrella and we hurried into the house. He gave me a change of clothes", which I readily accepted because I was freezing. While he was changing, I walked into his office and waited for him. Seeing him after all this time did some crazy things to my heart and I didn't know how to feel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I looked around and smiled when I saw a picture of the four of us from the fair we went to. We were on a roller coaster and my hair was flying back, a frightened look on my face. Michael was looking at me, laughing as I clung to him. I trailed my fingers down the frame, missing what we used to have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A sound came from Michael's computer and being the nosy person I was, I went to it, looked up to make sure he wasn't coming, and opened it up. His email was up and I scrolled through it, wondering what he had been up to for the past months. I frowned when I saw an email that said 'Do It Or Else'. It was dated a few months before I officially met Michael.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oh my god..."""" I covered my mouth as I read the words. The door opened and Michael came in", frowning when he saw me behind his desk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What are you doing?"""" He asked cautiously", but I wasn't listening to him. I was still trying to process what I had just read. He came over and looked at what I was reading and his face fell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ari...""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why didn't you tell me?"""" I whispered", turning around to face him. He ran a hand down his face, closing his eyes for a second.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I couldn't."""" He said simply.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Michael," they threatened Natalie! You could've told me and we could've gone to the police or something! You made me believe that you did this willingly."""" I said", eyes wide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I couldn't risk it," Ari. I wanted to protect her.....and you. You don't think for a second that I didn't think about telling you?!"""" He started raising his voice and he walked away from me"," shaking his head. """"When I met you"," I thought I could do it. Get close to you and hand you over. Then Natalie would finally be safe. But I fell for you."""" He stared out the window and then slapped his fist against it", holding it there and putting his forehead against the glass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He started laughing and I started to get worried. """"I fucking fell for you", so hard that I didn't know what was up or down. I wanted to do everything I could to protect you," get out of that....that deal. That's why I met up with Jeremy. I gave him money to leave the country in exchange for me getting out of the deal."""" I walked up behind him and he turned around"," a pained look taking over his face. """"I'm so sorry"," Ari.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shh, Michael it's not your fault," okay? What's done is done. Natalie is safe now and I'm safe."""" I said and he scoffed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah, you're safe but you're not mine. I love you, Ari and I know that you want nothing to do with me," but I just want you to know that--"""" I stopped him by kissing him. He was startled at first", but then he kissed me back with just as much passion as I gave. He wrapped his arms around my waist," pulling me close. I pulled back and smiled at him when he gave me a confused look. """"What was that for?' He asked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I love you too," Michael."""" His eyes lit up and his arms tightened around me. """"NowI feel bad because you didn't have a choice and if I'm going to be completely honest", I missed you a lot. I--I've always been in bad relationships and when I have one that's as good as the one we had," I get scared. Everyone leaves me and I--"""" My voice cracked and I swallowed before speaking again. """"--I don't want to be alone forever.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I won't ever leave you, Ari," you hear me? Look at me."""" I lifted my watery eyes to him and he cupped my cheeks. """"I don't care what happens from here on out. We'll always be honest with each other and get through everything together"," alright?"""" I nodded and sniffed", not wanting to shed any tears. He kissed me softly and then hugged me tight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Don't we have a party to get to?"""" I asked after we stood there for a while. Michael laughed and grabbed my hand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We sure do."""" We left the office and went down to celebrate Natalie's birthday.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64727;""""""Axel"," come on!"""" I yelled to my eighteen year old son. He was always taking long to get ready", now that he was in college.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mom," you know how he is. Always gotta impress the girls."""" My twelve year old daughter", Michelle commented, eating her cereal. I laughed and ruffled her dark blonde hair. She had grey eyes just like her brother.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So true. Axel," now!"""" I shouted", going into the kitchen to prepare breakfast. Michael walked in, carrying his briefcase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Leave the boy alone," babe. He has to make sure he's looking sharp."""" Michael winked at me and kissed my cheek. """"What's for breakfast?""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No breakfast for you," my dear. You defended Axel."""" I said", tasting my cooking. I felt Michael's presence behind me and I bit my lip, smiling to myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No breakfast for your wonderful husband? I thought I deserved better than that."""" He whispered in my ear", running his hands up my arms. After Natalie's fifth birthday, we dated for a year and a half longer before he swept me off to Bora Bora and proposed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Do you now?"""" I teased", turning my head to look up at him. He smiled and bent his head low to capture my lips between his. I closed my eyes, loving the feeling. I would never get used to this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh my god, Dad! Ew," I think I'm gonna puke."""" Natalie announced and we broke away", laughing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just wait your turn. You'll be doing the same thing."""" Michael said to his seventeen year old daughter. She just scoffed and shook her blonde curls", texting one of her friends.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Were they making out again?"""" Axel's deep voice asked as he came down the stairs. He had on a button down shirt with his sleeves were rolled up to his elbow. His dark jeans fit him nicely and his dark hair was gelled back. He was a handsome young man for sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You look just like your father."""" I said softly. And that he did. There was no doubt he was Daxton King's son and the way he carried himself showed just as much power as his father did.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I look nothing like Michael," Ma."""" He said winking one silver eye. I rolled my eyes and let him kiss my cheek. He didn't like to acknowledge Daxton as his father. To him"," the only father he had and cared for was Michael. """"What's for breakfast?"""" He asked. He towered over me with his 6'4"""" frame and I wondered when he would stop growing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alright," both of you lazy boys get out my kitchen. Go."""" I swatted them out", both protesting. After breakfast, Axel took his car and drove himself and his sisters to school. I waved to Michael as he took off to go to work and I sighed, knowing today was the day. The day I was going to meet up with Daxton. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He only went to prison for ten years because of his expensive lawyers. He got out when Axel was fourteen and Axel wanted nothing to do with him. He remembers clearly what his father did to him and me, and even Michael. Daxton wrote me a bunch of times, wanting to meet up, but I didn't have the confidence to do it until today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I drove to the park we used to go to all the time and waited for him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arielle.""""  I heard his voice before I saw him and I heard his footsteps walk around until he was facing me. His facial hair had grown out and he looked liked he aged more years than he actually was. He sat down next to me and I gripped the side of the bench. """"Why so nervous"," Ari?"""" His asked", humor in his voice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What do you want, Daxton? You wanted to meet," so here I am."""" I snapped", wanting to get straight to the point. He sighed and put his hands in his pockets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I want to meet Axel."""" I laughed at his request.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You know damn well he doesn't want to get to know you," Dax."""" I said. His green eyes flashed with anger before disappearing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He's my son. I deserve to see him. I haven't seen him in fourteen years."""" He said", gritting his teeth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And whose fault is that? You destroyed whatever bond you had with him and you will never," ever be able to take what you did back. You don't deserve to be a father."""" I spit out", getting up. I was done with this conversation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Don't walk away from me."""" Daxton's hand shot out and gripped my arm. I looked down at it as if he burned me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you don't let go of me right now, I'll kick your balls so hard," you'll wish your boyfriend from prison was here to save you."""" I threatened and he let go quickly. I shrugged my shoulders", adjusted my jacket and walked off, leaving Daxton in the park.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nothing and no one was going to ruin the perfect family I had," even if he was the father of my child.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"64728;""Math", the dreaded subject that rattles our minds and causes immense stress when test day comes. The class that makes us ask, “Am I actually going to use this in the future?” and “Do I actually care?”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Math, the class that pushes us to be creative and think harder. The subject that shapes our minds and makes us ask, “How can I solve this problem?” and “I wonder if there’s another way to do it.” ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I believe in math. Not the classes that teach us about area and perimeter, or derivatives and integrals. By looking behind the large numbers and intimidating equations, we learn life lessons that teach us to stay on path and to question what we are told. This I believe. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When other kids played on the swings, I learned to count. When other kids ran on the fields, I played addition games. When other kids drew pictures on the walls, I wrote the times tables on our windows. I know that everyone is thinking, wow, this kid was a loser. But to me, math was not only fun, but the beginning of a rewarding journey I would face in the future. The most basic in mathematics such as counting, adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing are things we all take for granted. In high school we are focusing so much on the variables, logs and exponentials, that we forget that everything we are learning now, stems from those fundamental mathematical properties. In life, this has taught me that what you learn as a child, your manners, your feelings, kindness, experiences, and curiosity, these things never change. And that sometimes, we need to step back and think about where we came from and who we were in order to understand who we have become and where we are going. 
As we move into more advanced mathematics, we learn about concepts that are hard to wrap our minds around. Like how the number zero is both nothing and something, and that infinity is never ending. We learn that i is an imaginary number and that you can take the negative of a number. But we never stop to think how can zero be multiplied to something if it's nothing, and if infinity plus 10 is larger than infinity. We don’t question how an imaginary number can exist and why a negative times a negative makes a positive. We accept these facts as the truth because we are told by our teachers and family that that’s just how it is. I’m not disputing the fact that these are true, but saying that what I’ve taken from these impossible to understand numbers is that it's ok to question concepts that are not easily grasped in order to better your own understanding. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of you are probably thinking, “I still don’t understand how any of this math relates to life lessons.” Honestly, it probably doesn’t for you. We are all different in our beliefs and how we learn. Whether it's learning teamwork from a sports field or persevering to perfect a music piece, we all learn in different ways. For me," I believe that factoring equations teaches us to restate things in a different way and that conics teach us that every change comes with a consequence. I believe that our maths tests compare the trials we face in our live and that studying is our preparation for anything thrown at us. I believe in math and the lessons we learn from looking a little deeper. This I believe.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"64767;""Roxanne was slumped over the desk", staring out the glass doors, the glare so harsh she could barely make out the used Hondas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A woman entered, heels clicking on the tile, chin held high, so that she was looking down on Roxanne," despite being 5'1"""". She looked wealthy", but rich people didn't live in this town. They especially didn't get their nails done at Amy's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Roxanne helped her, then slipped out for her break. The sun was beating down, but she found a little shade by the dumpsters. She leaned against the one-story building, puffing a cigarette.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She wasn't jealous of that woman, for all that she was dolled up, seemingly confident. Under that veneer of leopard print she was probably just scared. There was a reason people like that wore sunglasses indoors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Roxanne didn't want style for the sake of snobbery, a life spent clutching so tightly to money that you never spent a dime.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What did she want? A cruise. Diamonds. People to listen when she spoke.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She had always planned on going back to school, traveling. Course, she'd always put it off. There was always tomorrow, she'd said, when she found another day had trickled by while she'd stood still. She was forty now, tired, with permanent lines by her eyes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Her fifteen minutes ended. She stomped the cig on the concrete. Amy said if she worked real hard, she might make manager.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"64770;""   The windshield was no more blurry on that rainy night than the space within the car; two eyes coated in tears driving home to break the news. A slight swerving motion weaved the car; left", middle, right, middle. White knuckles grip a leather wheel; mind racing, knowing three children awaited their arrival on the velvet surface of a couch. Their youthful glance still possessing hope and prayer. Their naivety ill-prepared for the jerking sadness of a loss. Park the car in the driveway. A gentle caress guiding him to the door. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
   Those bright eyes he'd known he couldn't face. A patriarch in the home, wishing for nothing more than to be held, rocked. One of the three moved toward them, wrapping his arms around the woman's small waist. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"   """"Guys.."""" his voice cracked under pressure. Before he managed his next words"," the eldest knew. """"Tonight"," your Pop passed away."""" His knees gave out and", leaning against the door frame, he continued. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
