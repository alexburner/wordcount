# wordcount
Counting unique/total word ratio in a body of text

## strategy

1. Reads file "article.txt" in as utf-8 string
2. Splits string on non-word, non-apostrophe, and digit characters using regex
3. Uses a Map and sets each word as a key (duplicates will overwrite)
4. At the end, the number of map entries === the number of unique words

## material

- Node filesystem module https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html
- JS string split https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
- `/[^\w|â€™|']|\d/` regex pattern cobbled together on http://regexr.com/
